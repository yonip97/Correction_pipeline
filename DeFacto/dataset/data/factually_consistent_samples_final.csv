"Sheikh Nawwaf al-Melhem, a leader of the officially-tolerated opposition People's Party, told the BBC he had brokered an agreement between the state and inmates at Hama Central Prison. The prison's power and water supplies had now been restored, he said. Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar said the situation at the prison was normal and denied there had been any disorder. Human rights and opposition activists say the prisoners took guards hostage about a week ago as they tried to halt the transfer of several inmates to another facility where they believed they might be executed. Security forces reportedly surrounded the jail and twice failed to retake it by force. Sheikh Nawwaf, who is also a prominent tribal leader in central Syria, said he travelled to Hama Prison on Saturday afternoon. The inmates' demands focused on ensuring fair and speedy trials for those detained without trial, and the release of those held without charge, he added. Sheikh Nawwaf said he had presented the demands to Mr Shaar and Justice Minister Najm Hamad al-Ahmed in Hama on Sunday. He said a deal to end the mutiny was reached later that day and included a promise from the government of fair trials for political detainees. Leading rights activist Mazen Darwish, who is in touch with the prisoners, confirmed that a verbal agreement had been reached, but did not give any details. Another activist told Reuters news agency the government had ""agreed to most of our demands to release those political detainees held without charge"". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria, reported that 26 detainees would be released soon. Later on Monday, the official Sana news agency reported that Mr Shaar and Mr Ahmed had visited the prison, and that they promised to ""provide inmates' needs"" and ensure that none were mistreated. But it also cited a statement by the interior minister as saying that the situation there was ""normal, contrary to the lies and fabrications spread by malicious media outlets as part of their anti-Syria propaganda"". The reported deal came after conditions worsened inside the prison, with authorities cutting electricity and water supplies, and inmates reporting a food shortage and serious medical cases. Security forces also tried to storm the cell block where the prisoners were holding out on Friday and Saturday, using tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. The BBC was told that 15 prisoners were shot and wounded. The revolt was sparked by a move to transfer several detainees to the notorious Sednaya Prison near Damascus. ""You can't imagine, even in your worst nightmare, what kind of torture [takes place] in Sednaya,"" a lawyer who is in contact with the prisoners told the BBC. One activist group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, has documented the arrest and detention of more than 117,000 people in Syria since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011.","Syrian prisoners who took over a jail in the central city of Hama have agreed to end their revolt, a prominent opposition figure says.","['The summary states that Hama is a ""central city,"" but the text does not describe Hama as a central city.

"Instead of giving consent to cookies on every website they visit, users would be able to set general preferences. The European Commission said the plans, which would also remove banners for non-intrusive cookies, would help to tackle an ""overload"" of such requests. But experts warned the plans could harm advert-funded media, as well as platforms such as Facebook and Google. Cookies are small files that download on to a user's device and enable tracking, sometimes to power advertising. Since 2012, EU rules have required websites to tell users what cookies are being placed on their machine. Typically, this meant a pop-up window seeking consent. European Commission vice-president, Andrus Ansip, said it was now proposing simpler rules, ""so that internet users do not have to click on a banner every time they visit a website"". ""This way, people will be more in control of their settings,"" he said. Under the plans, websites could read the cookie preferences set in users' browsers. Also, banners would be scrapped for cookies that do not invade users' privacy, such as those remembering shopping cart history or counting website hits. Last year, many internet companies called for the EU to scrap the so-called ""cookie law"", introduced in 2012. However, the latest proposals could end up damaging online services and frustrate web users, according to a senior executive at a trade body that represents many of the world's biggest internet firms. ""The banners are certainly annoying. The question is whether they come up with something that's better or worse,"" said James Waterworth, vice-president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association. He warned the proposals could harm a range of companies, from Facebook through to newspapers, if many users opted against allowing all but the least intrusive cookies. ""If this is done wrong and it's much harder to obtain permission, then it could have a serious impact on ad-funded services,"" he told the BBC. Under the proposals, users could set a preference in their browser for the level of cookies to which they consent. But they might also need to do this in every app and on every device they log in to, advertising companies have warned. ""People who thought cookie banners were annoying, will be disappointed to hear that things won't get better,"" said Townsend Feehan, chief executive of Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe. The commission's proposals on privacy rules for electronic communications cover a range of areas, including: . The European Commission hopes to introduce the changes by May 2018, although experts warned that would be a tight timeline.

"I have been talking to two companies on Anglesey. Both have received EU funding but their owners have opposing views on whether to leave or remain. VOTING TO LEAVE . Gabitie Group employs eight people in Holyhead. It started in 2004 as an e-commerce company selling bedding, silk clothing and chandeliers but has diversified into making fabricated steel buildings, staircases and mezzanine floors. Most customers are in the south of England but it also exports to Australia and New Zealand and across Europe. Owner Grant Bond was undecided until recently but is now voting to leave, saying there was too much interference from the European Union. He believes Brexit might have a short term impact but in the long term be beneficial if it means less red tape for small business. ""On the face of it looks like it will have negative effect because it looks likely for a year or two we might face recession or financial issues,"" he said. ""But in the long term, the policies and bureaucracy of the EU are harming the business. A lot of what we have to do has to be up to standards and regulations which change almost on a daily basis. A lot of which doesn't make a lot of sense, as I'd argue British standards are often the best worldwide."" STILL NOT SURE . But Gabitie warehouse assistant Dale Murphy said he was undecided and said the campaigns were not really explaining the issues to young people. ""When you get the likes of Boris Johnson and David Cameron not agreeing on something, I don't know who to go with. ""I'll come to a conclusion but it's confusing - we don't know what the effects are going to be on us in the long run and this is something we have to think about because it's a big choice."" VOTING REMAIN . David Williams, owner of Plas Farm Dairies in Gaerwen, started his business in 1987 making frozen yogurt, ice cream and salads and employs 24 people. The company depends heavily on selling its goods on the continent with 40% of its trade to the rest of the European Union while only 5% goes to the rest of the world. Mr Williams said there was regulation in food production wherever they exported to in the world. ""It would be very damaging to our business if we left Europe because we work very closely with our customers in Europe. It's very much a partnership and it would be a blow to leave. ""Hopefully we'd keep as much of it going as we can but there are likely to be some levies. If you think bureaucracy is bad in Europe, try selling to China and India; in my experience it's much worse. ""I think it's really important to the financial well being of this area in Wales; the home market isn't very strong, the population isn't very big, we need exports. And the idea we can build them up from outside Europe in that short time is ridiculous."" Businesses' approach to EU membership may well come down to the sector they work in and the markets they sell in though uncertainty is always a concern. Polls suggest that companies tend to be in favour of remaining but businesses do not have a vote - so it will come down to individuals what they mark on their ballot papers on 23 June.","As the UK prepares to vote on whether to stay in or leave the European Union, some small businesses are still undecided.","['The summary states that some small businesses are still undecided, but the text does not mention any businesses being undecided.

"The Cabinet Office said the election for the vacant seat, planned for 4 May, would now take place on 8 June as part of the nationwide polling day. MPs will be asked to formally overturn the writ for the poll. The proposed by-election would have created the anomaly of taking place after Parliament had been dissolved. The by-election was caused by the death of long-serving Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman in February. Commons Leader David Lidington told MPs there was no statutory provision allowing for the cancellation of a by-election when a general election was in progress. But he said a precedent was set in a similar situation in 1923, when a by-election writ was regarded as having been superseded.

"Sales volumes were 1.3% higher in the month compared with March. They were also 4.3% higher than a year earlier, the Office For National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS revised March's retail sales figures, showing retail sales fell by just 0.5% rather than 1.3%, as first estimated. ""Clothing stores remain the main drag on growth in the retail sector, with sales hampered by unseasonal weather. However... sales increased in April compared with March as lower prices boosted sales,"" said ONS statistician Melanie Richard. Colder than usual weather had also dented spending in March, hurting demand for spring and summer clothes, according to the ONS and surveys from the British Retail Consortium and the CBI. The latest ONS figures showed total average store prices in April were 2.8% lower than a year earlier, dragged down by a 7.3% drop in fuel prices. Food store prices fell 2.3% amid the continuing supermarket price war. However, the total amount spent in April increased by 2.1% to Â£28.1bn compared with the year before. Keith Richardson, of Lloyds Bank commercial banking, said a rush to complete property deals before a stamp duty rise came into effect in April had helped to boost demand for household goods and furniture. Vicky Redwood, chief economist at Capital Economics, said that consumer confidence did not seem to have been adversely affected by the UK's upcoming referendum on EU membership. ""Indeed, consumer spending should prevent the economy from slowing too much this quarter, even if referendum uncertainty has a bigger impact on business confidence and investment,"" she said. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the rise in April's retail sales was welcome, but highlighted imbalances in the UK economy. ""After the disappointing decline in March, the strong retail sales recovery in April supports our view that in spite of major headwinds the UK economy continues to grow, albeit at a slowing pace,"" said David Kern, BCC chief economist. ""However, the contrast between buoyant retail sales and the problems facing other sectors such as manufacturing highlights the unbalanced nature of Britain's recovery."" The BCC called for ""a more balanced economic structure with a stronger focus on exports, investment and manufacturing"". The stronger-than-expected retail sales figures pushed up the value of the pound. Sterling rose against the euro by 0.3% to â‚¬1.3053, and climbed 0.2% against the dollar to $1.4625.","UK retail sales rose by more than expected in April, helped by lower prices, official figures have shown.","['The summary states that UK retail sales rose by more than expected, but the source text does not mention any expectations or whether the rise exceeded them.']",[],0
"AMs vote on introducing a ban in the Senedd next week. The issue has caused tensions within the Labour group, with the Welsh government ruling out changing the law before next year's assembly elections. One Labour AM, Christine Chapman, spoke last year of feeling ""cheated"" that ministers had not addressed the issue. In a joint letter published in this morning's Western Mail, the Most Reverend Barry Morgan, Professor Sally Holland and Phil Bale, leader of Cardiff Council, argue that a ban would simply give children the same protection in law as adults. They write: ""We call on the First Minister and Welsh Government to allow Labour AMs a free (conscience) vote on an amendment to the Violence against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (Wales) Bill concerning the physical punishment of children, and we call upon all AMs to support this amendment. ""The amendment would remove the defence of 'reasonable punishment' in relation to assaults on children in Wales and finally give children the legal protection from physical harm that they deserve.""

"David Brickwood, 74, was stabbed five times in Northampton on 26 September in a ""violent and dreadful"" attack. One of his sons, Dale Brickwood, said the family was becoming ""increasingly frustrated"" the killers had not yet been brought to justice. Police said the case was ""a priority"" they were ""committed"" to solving. Mr Brickwood was attacked when several men broke into his Lindsay Avenue home in the early hours of the morning. He was left with multiple stab wounds to the head, leg and hand. The scrap metal dealer was known to keep money in his house. His son Dale said the family was not sure how much was taken but during a Crimewatch reconstruction on 8 February police appealed for ""anyone [who has] come into contact with a large amount of old style £20 and £50 notes"" to come forward. His son said watches and jewellery were also taken. The offenders would have been ""covered in blood"", officers said, but despite that, no-one has been charged. Two men arrested shortly after the murder were released with no further action. Three other men remain on bail. Mr Brickwood criticised Northamptonshire Police for a lack of communication, saying: ""We seem to be finding information and giving it to them."" The police ""don't really talk to us"", he added. Northamptonshire Police said two family liaison officers had been assigned plus a ""dedicated team of detectives"". Det Ch Insp Mick Graham, leading the investigation, said: ""I can fully understand that the family and friends of David may be frustrated. ""The investigation team share that frustration and empathise with David's family."" He said there was ""a lot of rumour and speculation locally"", but added: ""We need the people with the critical pieces of information and evidence to come forward."" However, the family has been left ""so demoralised"" after the recent Crimewatch appeal failed to lead to further arrests, Dale Brickwood said. ""It's disgusting.

"Security organisations had previously identified Iran as one of at least eight countries targeted by the code. The spyware is believed to have been designed to steal data to help launch further cyber attacks. The sender has not been identified, but researchers have found a reference to a US television programme in Duqu's code. The Iranian news agency, IRNA, reported that the country's cyber defence unit was taking steps to combat the infection. ""The software to control the virus has been developed and made available to organisations and corporations,"" Brigadier General Gholamreza Jalali, head of Iran's civil defence body, is quoted as saying. ""All the organisations and centres that could be susceptible to being contaminated are being controlled."" Mr Jalali said a ""final report"" into which organisations had been targeted was still being worked on. Last year the Iranian government accused the West of trying to disrupt its nuclear facilities using the Stuxnet worm computer attack. Then in April 2011 officials said the country's facilities had been targeted by a second piece of malware dubbed ""Stars"". Officials now describe the Duqu attack as the ""third virus"" to hit Iran. The computer security specialist Kaspersky Lab said it believed that ""Stars"" was a keylogging program that may have been part of the same attack that installed Duqu. Keylogging programs are able to collect information about a computer system, take screenshots, search for files and capture passwords. The firm also provided more detail about how Duqu worked based on its analysis of other targets. It said another unidentified company received an email from an individual identifying himself as Mr B Jason who requested a joint business venture. The firm believed this was a reference to the Jason Bourne books and spy movies. The recipient was asked to open a Microsoft Word attachment that referenced the targeted company's name in its title, and thus did not appear to be spam. It said that for every victim a separate set of attack files was created using a different control server. The firm said this happened at least 12 times. When the addressee opened the file the malware became active through a Truetype font exploit, but did nothing until it detected that there had been no keyboard or mouse activity for ten minutes. Kaspersky Lab said the font was called Dexter Regular and its creators were identified as Showtime Inc. ""This is another prank pulled by the Duqu authors, since Showtime Inc is the cable broadcasting company behind the TV series Dexter, about a CSI doctor who happens also to be a serial killer,"" the report said. The firm said the exploit then loaded a driver onto the system. Analysis of the driver suggested it was compiled as long ago as August 2007. ""If this information is correct, then the authors of Duqu must have been working on this project for over four years,"" the report said. The firm said the driver then began a process that led to the Duqu trojan being installed allowing the attackers to introduce new modules, infect other networked computers, and collect information. The company said efforts to identify the attackers have been complicated by the fact that the suspects appear to have deactivated several of the control servers thought to have been involved in the attacks.",Iranian officials have confirmed that the country has been hit by malware known as Duqu.,[],[],0
"A conference next month at the city's National Waterfront Museum will hear from delegates who have turned around the fortunes of Sydney, Australia, and Antwerp, Belgium. It is being organised by the Design Commission for Wales in partnership with Swansea council. One council leader said Swansea must rethink what makes a city successful. It follows a series of shop closures across the city centre in recent years, followed by the loss of a Â£1bn project to transform the shopping district, when developers plumped to invest in the out-of-town Parc Tawe instead. Robert Francis-Davies, Swansea council's cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration, said they needed to examine what makes a winning city. ""Shopping is a major part of the city centre offer here, but a lot more needs to be available to generate the footfall our traders need,"" he said. ""The city centre has to become a place that people want to go - a destination that's both easy to get to and offers a range of events that will create a buzz and attract people."" Initiatives have already begun to try and lure people back into town. This week retailers have been invited to take to the streets on temporary market stalls in order to drum up passing trade with a variety of themed events. Last weekend saw the re-launch of the Big Heart of Swansea loyalty card which offers discounts at participating stores within the city centre's Business Improvement District (BID). According to Russell Greenslade, chief executive of Swansea BID, around 500 shoppers snapped up the offer on its first day. ""The beauty of the loyalty card is that discounts can only be redeemed in-store,"" he said. ""This helps attract more visitors into the city centre and boosts our traders. It's one of many schemes on which we work closely with Swansea council to benefit our city centre businesses."" But Julie Williamson, who chairs Swansea Bay's Federation of Small Businesses, said the success of the city lay with all businesses - not just the shops. ""Of course we need a healthy retail sector, but what keeps those shops going is the workers from other offices and businesses coming into town every day, and shopping in their lunch breaks and after work. And it's those other businesses which are leaving in increasing numbers.""",Experts from around the world are set to come to Swansea to help turn around the fortunes of the city centre.,[],[],0

One of the most contentious episodes saw a woman hired to strip assaulted at a team party earlier this year.

This season itself, star scrum-half Aaron Smith was at the centre of a scandal after he was seen entering a toilet cubicle with a woman at Christchurch Airport. He was later found guilty of misconduct. ""In the same way that rugby seeks to do better on the field, we must constantly seek ways to improve off the field,"" NZR chief executive Steve Tew said.

"The two firms should be barred from any US mergers and acquisitions, according to a House Intelligence Committee report. The panel says the firms failed to allay fears about their association with China's government and military. Huawei and ZTE denied the accusations in front of the panel in September. On Monday ZTE issued a statement insisting its equipment met all US standards and posed no threat. ""ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for co-operation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation,"" China's Xinhua news agency quoted the firm as saying. How China became the US election bogeyman . Huawei's vice-president, William Plummer, said the latest accusations were ""dangerous political distractions"". ""Purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignores technical and commercial realities, recklessly threatens American jobs and innovation, does nothing to protect national security."" While the House Intelligence report stopped short of calling for a boycott of the firms' mobile phone products, it was highly critical of the two companies. ""China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,"" the report says. ""Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems."" The panel said their investigation had received credible allegations from current and former Huawei employees of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behaviour and copyright infringement. Republican committee chairman Mike Rogers said they had passed on information to the FBI to investigate the allegations. ""We've come to the conclusion, unfortunately, they are not private entities,"" Mr Rogers said on Monday. On Sunday, Mr Rogers delivered a blunt verdict to the 60 Minutes programme on US network CBS. ""If I were an American company today... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,"" he said. Among the report's recommendations were to exclude any Huawei or ZTE equipment or component parts from being used by government contractors, as well both companies becoming ""more transparent and responsive to US legal obligations"". China's Foreign Ministry urged the US to ""set aside prejudices"" regarding the two firms. ""Chinese telecoms companies have been developing their international business based on market economy principles,"" ministry spokesman Hong Lei said. ""Their investment in the United States embodies the mutually beneficial nature of Sino-American economic and trade relations."" Huawei was started by Ren Zhengfei, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, in 1987. As the firm has grown to become one of the largest global players in the sector, fears about its ties with the Chinese military have frequently surfaced. There have been concerns and allegations that it was helping China gather information on foreign states and companies, charges that the firm has denied. Last year, its purchase of American computer company 3Leaf systems, was rejected by a US security panel. Earlier this year, it along with ZTE, faced allegations that some of their equipment had been installed with codes to relay sensitive information back to China. Senior executives from the two companies denied those allegations when they appeared before US lawmakers in September. ZTE is also facing accusations it sold US telecoms equipment to Iran, in breach of US sanctions. Telecoms giant Cisco on Monday ended its relationship with ZTE, Reuters reported, after its equipment was included in the Tehran deal. This latest report comes in the midst of a US presidential campaign in which China has become a hot topic. Both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney have pledged to increase the pressure on Beijing on issues ranging from China's currency policy to state subsidies for Chinese firms. Earlier this month, Mr Obama signed an order blocking a deal by a Chinese firm, Ralls Corp, to acquire four wind farm projects near a US naval facility in Oregon. It was the first foreign investment to be blocked in the US for 22 years.

The Tories have more county council seats than in 2013 - adding five extra seats - even if you take into account that this time there are 78 councillors up for election - one more than in 2013 thanks to boundary changes. The Lib Dems have made progress, gaining an extra two seats in the county, including taking St Albans North from Labour. They still have five seats in St Albans - although they lost St Stephen's ward to the Conservatives - with the party claiming it reflects their pro-European stance in the city which voted against Brexit. Labour have lost six seats, including their leader on the county council, Leon Reefe, plus three seats in Stevenage. Sandy Walkington, re-elected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for St Albans South, said the party's positive attitude towards Europe had been well-received in the city.

"Lord Patten, who supports the UK remaining in the EU, said Mr Johnson, a prominent Leave campaigner, ""just makes it up as he goes along"". He also said it would be ""very difficult"" for David Cameron to remain leader if the UK voted to leave the EU. Vote Leave said it was saddened at ""the level of debate"" from the Remain camp. Mr Johnson has previously said voters want proper debate and to hear about the issues, ""not personal attacks"". The UK decides whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June. The Conservative Party is deeply split over the the issue, with David Cameron and most of his cabinet campaigning for a Remain vote but about half of the MPs supporting an EU exit. The debate inside the party has turned increasingly acrimonious, with former deputy prime minister and pro-Remain campaigner Lord Heseltine recently accusing Mr Johnson of losing his judgement over the EU. Lord Patten, Tory party chairman from 1990 to 1992, added to that criticism of the former London mayor, in an interview with Newsnight's David Grossman on Friday. ""Boris just makes it up as he goes along, and you come across people like that,"" he said. ""There's a sense in which you can't call Boris a liar. I think he's one of those people in life who simply doesn't really understand the difference between fact and fiction."" He added: ""If he can make a good joke by saying something, or if he can write a newspaper article by referring to Hitler and the European Union, he does it - and he doesn't think about it. ""He'll be saying the opposite in a few months' time."" Lord Patten, a European commissioner from 2000 to 2004, said Mr Johnson was an ""amiable"" character, but added: ""Boris is Boris. Tommy Cooper was Tommy Cooper."" In response, Vote Leave said: ""It's sad to see the level of debate the 'Remainers' have been reduced to. They were wrong about the euro then and they are wrong now."" And speaking to BBC Newsnight, Leave campaigner Jacob Rees Mogg suggested that Lord Patten's ""anger is almost certainly synthetic"". The MP suggested Lord Patten was trying to ""bash down"" Mr Johnson because he knows that the former London mayor was ""hugely popular and trusted"" and was making the case for an EU exit ""exceptionally effectively"". The Daily Mail reported earlier this week that ""senior party figures"" had warned of a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron after 23 June, whatever the outcome, over his handling of the referendum campaign. On the question of re-uniting the Conservative Party after the referendum, Lord Patten said that if the UK voted to Leave the EU it would be ""very difficult"" for Mr Cameron to stay on as leader. ""Are people like Michael Gove and Mr Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith... are they all going to require Mr Cameron to go cap in hand around Europe for the next few years trying to negotiate new trade deals and new agreements with the EU? ""I don't know,"" he said. Lord Patten said if Britain voted to remain in the EU, Mr Cameron would have to assert his authority and try to bring the party together. But he suggested the PM should give Mr Johnson a challenging cabinet post, such as running the Department for Health. ""That will really test whether there is something behind all the jokes,"" he said. Lord Patten also criticised the wider Vote Leave campaign, saying it's objective appeared to be ""to keep the turnout as low as possible and to tell young people to stay at home and not vote"", which , he said, was ""extraordinary"". And he added: ""I worry that for a lot of the Brexiteers, in a sort of spittle-flecked way, this is a neverendum, not a referendum."" Also in the interview, the former Tory party chairman conceded that he had made the wrong call on Britain joining the Euro. ""I put my hand up,"" he said.

"The Sahara chief was arrested on Friday after he failed to appear before the judges in connection with a fraud case. Two Sahara firms were ordered to repay 240bn rupees ($3.9bn; Â£2.3bn) to investors that market regulators said they had raised illegally. On Tuesday, a protester threw ink on Mr Roy's face as he arrived at the court. ""Subrata Roy is a thief. He has cheated and robbed us,"" his attacker shouted. The man, identified as a lawyer by Indian television channels, was taken away by the police. Profile: Subrata Roy . It was not immediately clear whether the businessman would now be sent to jail. Since his arrest, he has been lodged in government guest houses. The Supreme Court set the next hearing for 11 March. On Tuesday, Mr Roy apologised to the court saying his reasons for not appearing before the judges last Wednesday ""were genuine"". He said Sahara would sell its assets and pay back the investors and asked the judges to give him more time. But the court rejected his proposal saying ""we are not interested in selling the properties, you have been telling us for the last two years, it is your headache, you should have done it"". The judges also ordered police to take two other Sahara directors into custody and hold them until the next hearing. The case against Mr Roy stretches back to August 2012, when the court ordered the two Sahara firms implicated to refund money to 22 million small investors within 90 days and with 15% interest. In December 2012, the court gave the firms more time to repay. In February last year, market regulators froze the firms' bank accounts saying they had failed to refund the money. But Sahara disputes the amount it should pay back, saying its liability should be no more than the 51.2bn rupees it has already paid back. Mr Roy is a household name in India. His group, worth $11bn, has businesses ranging from finance, housing and manufacturing to aviation and the media. It also has interests overseas - it owns New York's landmark Plaza Hotel and London's iconic Grosvenor House.

However, National Museums Scotland is also bidding to host the artefacts. A meeting takes place on Thursday to discuss their fate. The objects were discovered by a metal detectorist in Dumfries and Galloway in 2014. The Galloway Viking Hoard (GVH) group is backing the council's bid to ensure they end up in Kirkcudbright.

"Archaeologists used a range of techniques to determine the age, diet and health of livestock raised at two sites in Orkney. One of the sites, Earl's Bu, appears to have been organised and managed as a large estate farm. It may have been run this way from an earlier time than previously thought. The study, which involved excavated animal remains and the examination of other historical evidence, could give fresh insights into ancient farming elsewhere. The University of the Highlands and Islands, which did the research, said these other places could include other Scottish islands and Scandinavia. The archaeologists said the good condition of the livestock at Earl's Bu gave an ""overall impression"" of an organised system of pastoral farming on the land. Herds of sheep and cattle were pastured and fattened up in established fields or upland areas, they said. This suggests that an elite group of people controlled the land in the form of manorial estates from the Viking period onwards. The archaeologists said that this challenged the view of agriculture in the 9th to 11th Century being ""dominated by free peasant farmers with varying degrees of obligation to chieftains and larger farmers"".",A new study has shed new light on ancient Scottish farming.,[],[],0
"Iron ore delivered into China fell 8.3% on Monday after Beijing reported weak export data over the weekend. China is one of the biggest consumers of the commodity and there are concerns a slowdown in its economy may hurt demand and impact miners' profits. Shares of BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Glencore Xstrata all fell. Rio Tinto shares ended the day down by 5.7%, while BHP Billiton fell more than 4% on the Australian Securities Exchange. Fortescue Metals tumbled nearly 10% in Sydney on Monday. Mining stocks listed in London were also hurt, with Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore Xstrata all down by more than 2%. Recent demand for minerals like iron ore and copper has been driven in part by China's export boom, as well as government-led infrastructure spending. That has seen miners become increasingly dependent on China for growth. However, over the weekend, China reported a surprise 18.1% fall in exports for February, compared to the same month last year. A fall in China's steel futures also hurt mining shares because iron ore is a key ingredient in steel manufacture. Fears of slowing demand from China have added to slides in other commodity prices, like that of copper, which has dropped to its lowest level in more than seven months. China is the biggest buyer of the metal, which is used in electronics production and other manufacturing industries.

"Palm-sized fidget spinners have become the latest ""must-have"" for children. But while some schools have banned the toys as a distraction, Castle Gardens Primary School in Newtownards, County Down, has taken a different approach. The toys are being used as a teaching aid in some maths and English lessons. Primary four teacher Heather Hutchinson is behind the idea. ""These crazes come into school and you either go with them or they're a complete annoyance,"" she said. ""The children wanted to know whose spinner was going to spin the longest, so I saw an opportunity for a maths investigation."" ""They timed each other's spin, recorded it on a table and then put it on to a graph."" ""It was an opportunity for something a bit different with their learning."" There are strict rules on when the spinners can be used in Ms Hutchinson's class, however. She collects them at the start of the school day and only hands them out for certain lessons. Her pupils have also honed their English skills by holding debates on whether they should be allowed in school and writing up their opinions. Despite all of the children owning fidget spinners, they are divided on their role in school. Eight-year-old Zach thinks they are a good idea. ""If you don't have neat writing you can spin them to help your finger muscles,"" he said. But his classmate Anna disagrees. ""I don't think they should be allowed in class, as they distract the teacher and if you were asked a question you wouldn't know what to do as you'd be sitting fidgeting,"" she said. Fidget spinners were originally developed as a way for children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism to relieve stress. When it is placed between the thumb and a finger, the child can give it a quick flick to trigger a spin. There are many different types but the most popular is a small, three-pronged one with rounded ends. There are many different types but the most popular is a small, three-pronged one with rounded ends. There have been safety concerns, however, about ones with sharp edges or spikes. Castle Gardens principal John Gray said his staff checked which fidget spinners children are bringing into school. ""It is using a degree of common sense,"" he said. ""Ones that are appropriate and safe will be used and if they're not, the children wouldn't be allowed to have them and they'll be returned to the parents at the end of the day.""

"The visitors' centre was one of the few elements of the County Antrim prison praised in a recent damning report. But the bus that took people between the centre and the prison stopped after the start of a new contract. The Northern Ireland Prison Service said it has arrangements in place to ""assist people with mobility issues"". Just before Christmas, a private company took over the running of the visitors' centre from the Quaker Service, a family support charity, and the bus service ended. Malcolm McCormick said that has made it difficult for people to visit the jail as it is too far to walk. He had been visiting a friend regularly in the prison, but because of his disabilities he could not drive and had to use public transport. But when he arrived at the visitors' centre at the start of December he was told he would have to make his own way to the prison entrance. ""[The prison] is not the right access level for visiting,"" he said. ""They really don't care about people who've got disabilities, or people who have to go visit their loved ones inside."" Until December, Mr McCormick chose a train closest to his visit, and then waited at the visitors' centre until his time slot, like many other prison visitors. They were then taken to the main prison in a minibus, which, like the visitors' centre, was run by the Quaker Service. But when the contract for the visitors' centre was awarded to a private company, the provision of a bus was not included in the tender. It is about a quarter of a mile from the centre to the prison, which Mr McCormick said was too far for him and others, ""especially people with mobility problems, people with bad sight, or carrying children"". He said although a taxi was able to drop him at the main building from the train station, he was not able to wait in the prison building itself and that the visitors' centre was the only place people could wait. Mr McCormick felt his only option was to get a taxi all the way from Belfast, costing him ""about forty quid on each visit"". The recent report on Maghaberry Prison was damning on almost all fronts, but it did give one area a glowing review. It said: ""The welcoming visitors' centre continued to offer good support, including to first-time visitors who were identified. ""The bus transporting visitors between the visitors' centre, the searching area and the prison also now provided a service to and from the local Moira train station."" Mr McCormick said the prison service needs to do more to help visitors. Raymond McCartney, the deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly's justice committee, said there should be ""compassion"" shown to prisoners' families and friends visiting the jail.

"Garry Barlow, 49, from Liverpool, was one of six Britons killed by Islamist militants in the siege. Lorraine Barlow told the BBC she had been given no information about the progress of the investigation or whether there was sufficient security. The siege ended after Algerian forces stormed the site. Mrs Barlow first learned about the attack on the gas facility when her husband called and said he had been taken hostage by extremists who had strapped explosives to his body. She had two more increasingly frantic calls but was later told he had been killed. In an interview with the BBC, Mrs Barlow said she was shocked and distressed at the attitude of BP - which is part of the joint venture that runs the site - after her family were not invited to a memorial service. The company said her husband was employed by an agency and not BP. In a statement, BP said: ""The terrorist attack at In Amenas was an unprecedented and horrific criminal terrorist act which has profoundly impacted the lives of many people. ""Our thoughts and sympathies remain with the families of all those who were killed. ""The In Amenas plant is run by a joint venture between Sonatrach, (the national oil company of Algeria), BP and Statoil. ""The joint venture has its own management and operates independently.

"The All Party Parliamentary Group on Hunger warns too many children have to survive on crisps and energy drinks when school kitchens are closed. One group had to drop out of a summer football scheme because they had not eaten a meal in days, its report says. The Department for Work and Pensions says it is committed to tackling child poverty and disadvantage. According to the report, children at risk of holiday hunger include an estimated: . For both groups, school holidays place extra burdens on family budgets in terms of food, fuel, activities and childcare. The report says this is sometimes ""compounded"" by a shortage of skills to cook and shop on a budget. It claims the loss of free school meals adds between £30 and £40 per week to parents' outgoings for one child. The Family and Childcare Trust told the inquiry that three out of four local authorities do not have enough childcare in the school holidays. Parents working on zero-hours contracts were said to be particularly vulnerable to the higher costs of childcare. Evidence during the two-month long inquiry to the group, included children reported to have vomited from lack of food, while others were being fed flavoured water or cereal as their parents could not afford proper meals for them. Referring to the group which had to drop out of playing football, the report says: ""Their bodies simply gave up on them,"" says the report. Too many children return to school malnourished, sluggish and dreary, says the report. They are often weeks or months intellectually behind their better-off classmates who have a more wholesome diet during the holidays, it adds. It urges the government to set aside 10% of the tax on sugary drinks, due to start next year, to allocate £100,000 to every council to fund schemes to ensure that children are properly fed during the school holidays. It claims the cost of providing free meals and activities during holidays can be £1.50 per child per day. The report urges ministers to impose a statutory requirement on local authorities to run schemes delivering ""free meals and fun"" for children during school holidays, with voluntary groups ""in the driving seat wherever possible"". In the ""fifth richest country in the world, too many children are stalked by hunger,"" said committee chairman Frank Field in his foreword, describing the evidence as ""staggering"". While highlighting examples of those tackling the problem, he said ""abolishing hunger during school holidays is beyond the ability of individual community groups and volunteers alone"". Dr Philippa Whitford, a vice chair of the group, said that losing access to free school meals during the holidays could ""simply be the final straw which overwhelms some families' ability to keep their children fed and, particularly, nourished"". ""Hidden hunger does not just result in underweight children... those who are eating a stodgy low-protein diet, with no fresh fruit or vegetables, can end up both obese and yet malnourished,"" she said. In its response to the report, the Department for Work and Pensions also said the employment rate was the joint highest since records began and the number of children growing up in workless families is at a record low. A spokesman added that more than £90bn a year was being spent on working age benefits to provide a ""safety net"".

"The islands, located off the coast of Cornwall, began the scheme two years ago to protect eggs and baby birds from being eaten by brown rats. Numbers of manx shearwaters and storm petrels had declined by 25% on St Agnes and Gugh in 25 years. But colonies are recovering thanks to the rat eradication measures. Poison placed in an agricultural pipe was positioned in 1,000 locations on the islands in order to kill the vermin. According to international protocols, the islands could not be officially declared rat-free for two years after the last sign of rat was detected - making them officially free of the rodent on 13 February. Jaclyn Pearson, from the RSPB Isles of Scilly seabird recovery project, said the seabird population was already starting to recover. ""Straight away we saw results,"" she said.

"Reform Scotland said its research suggested more than half of delays to trains in Scotland were due to Network Rail faults rather than ScotRail. It said devolving the organisation would allow a ""clear line of accountability"" when things go wrong. Network Rail is funded by Transport Scotland but is ultimately accountable to Westminster, not Holyrood. A spokesman for Network Rail said: ""We work closely with the Scottish and UK governments to continually enhance and improve our railways. Any discussions over further devolution of Network Rail in Scotland would be a matter for those governments"". The full devolution of Network Rail - which is responsible for maintaining rail infrastructure - has been a long-standing ambition of the Scottish government. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said last month that the move would help to reverse ""the current unacceptable industry performance"" in Scotland. It comes amid ongoing concern over delays and cancellations to ScotRail trains since Dutch firm Abellio took over the contract last year, which has led to Mr Yousaf suggesting that the rail franchise could be taken over by the public sector in the future. Mr Yousaf is to attend a conference on Tuesday alongside Abellio and Network Rail officials aimed at exploring the future of Scotland's railways. In its Track to the Future report, Reform Scotland said 54% of trains which were delayed by more than three minutes had been attributed to Network Rail faults. The report was written by Reform Scotland's research director Alison Payne and Tom Harris, the former Labour MP and UK transport minister. Mr Harris said: ""The current debate over whether or not to nationalise ScotRail misses the point. 54% of delays are the fault of Network Rail. Nationalising ScotRail won't make the trains run on time and it is self-defeating for any politician to imply otherwise. ""Instead, we need fundamental change to the governance of Network Rail. The Scottish government is responsible for the strategic direction and funding of the Scottish rail network, but this responsibility cannot be properly exercised while Network Rail remains answerable to the UK government. ""Reform Scotland believes that Network Rail in Scotland should be fully accountable to the Scottish government, and that means it must be devolved."" The report, which examines the modernisation of Scottish railways, also found that journey times in Scotland compared unfavourably with those of a similar distance in England. For example, Edinburgh to Aberdeen and London to Birmingham are roughly the same distance, but the former takes well over two hours and the latter less than 90 minutes. Birmingham and Manchester are 25% further apart than Glasgow and Dundee, but the train takes 15 minutes less to arrive. While it welcomed recent investment in the railways, the report said upgrading lines while trying to use them could cause additional problems and added that investments such as the Borders Railway had been ""short-sighted"". The new line from Edinburgh to Tweedbank is not electrified and is single-track. The report said the Scottish government should future-proof all new rail investment by ensuring that it is double-track and electrified where possible. And it called for the creation of a ""bold and ambitious"" Scottish Rail Infrastructure Commission to look into faster rail links for the future, including from the central belt to both the north and the south, and looking at strategic inter- and intra-city rail links within Scotland. The report found that, under current proposals, over the next 30 years people will be able to travel by train from the central belt to London faster than from the central belt to Inverness, despite the former being around 400 miles while the latter is only 160 miles. Mr Harris added: ""Ongoing improvements are vital and the Scottish government should be congratulated for investing in this area, but we need to think about the bigger picture and create a bold strategy for the future. ""Our rail infrastructure is deficient. We should not tolerate a situation where a resident of Glasgow can get to London faster than she can get to Inverness, because Scotland's cities are too poorly connected.""","Network Rail should be devolved to the Scottish government, according to a new report.",[],"['The summary refers to the report as ""new,"" but the text does not specify that the report is new.']",0
"The North Shields-based Homeland prawn boat was in collision with the Scottish Viking off the Berwickshire coast just before 2000 BST on Thursday. Two fishermen, who are brothers, were on board the trawler. One, aged 20, was pulled to safety by another boat. The search for the other brother, thought to be 16, has been called off. Fred Caygill from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) told the BBC a crewman from another vessel had seen the missing boy in the water at 2025 BST on Thursday, but he then slipped from view. The MCA confirmed the search was terminated at 1400 BST on Friday, a decision which had followed 17 hours of searching, when expected survivability had been exceeded. Mr Caygill said it was unclear as to whether the missing boy, or his brother, were wearing lifejackets, but two were found in the flotsam. He said: ""The survivability period for someone in the water has passed. ""Different factors affect different people's chances of survival, but it has been a long time."" More than 20 fishing vessels and lifeboats were involved in the search, which spanned an area of more than 30 square miles off St Abb's Head. The Scottish Viking ferry, which was travelling between Rosyth and Zeebrugge, is operated by the Dutch company Norfolkline, owned by DFDS Seaways. The firm said the ship was chartered by Norfolkline from Italian firm Visentini, and was expected to arrive in Belgium on Friday afternoon. A DFDS Seaways spokesman said: ""We are deeply concerned about this and there will now follow an investigation by the authorities which we will fully assist with.

"The jet has been painted in the colours used at the time of the battle, which ran from July to September 1940. It also bears a red devil emblem in honour of the only RAF Fighter Command pilot awarded a Victoria Cross in the conflict. It was revealed during a ceremony at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire. The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF. Their ultimate failure was one of the turning points of the Second World War and prevented Germany from invading Britain. During the unveiling ceremony, Wing Commander James Heald from RAF Coningsby, said: ""What we've tried to do is recreate the paint job of the Hurricane flown by Flt Lt James Nicolson, who was the only Victoria Cross winner of the Battle of Britain. ""He was damaged and wounded and was in the process of bailing out when an enemy aircraft appeared in front of him,"" he said. ""So he climbed back in - shot down the enemy aircraft - then continued with his bail out."" The commemorative Typhoon will fly alongside a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire at air shows during the summer. It will be flown by Flt Lt Ben Westoby-Brooks, who said: ""It is a great privilege to fly this extraordinary aircraft in recognition of the sacrifices made by our predecessors 75 years ago. ""Their task of securing the skies was critical in the summer of 1940 and it's an honour to pay tribute to those few brave airmen who gave their all when the stakes were so high.""",An RAF Typhoon jet has been unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.,[],[],0
"The government wants to offer rail season ticket holders a ""free week"" in the wake of criticism of services. ScotRail boss Phil Verster told MSPs talks are ongoing over how the plans will work and how they can be funded. He said he had been told to use money from a rail improvement fund already earmarked for other projects, and ""couldn't vouch"" for it going ahead. The Scottish government said it ""remains absolutely committed"" to the initiative. The Â£3m scheme was announced as part of the Scottish government's draft budget, in a move to compensate passengers after a series of delays and disruptions on the rail network. Appearing before MSPs on the rural economy and connectivity committee, Mr Verster said he first heard of the project ""two to three weeks"" before Transport Minister Humza Yousaf announced it. He told members there were plans to use Â£1.8m from the Service Quality Incentive Regime (Squire) railway improvement fund, which is controlled by Abellio ScotRail alliance and built up through fines and penalties imposed for delays and other infractions. The cash had already been earmarked for ""other initiatives"". SNP MSP Christine Grahame asked Mr Verster if the firm, as a private company, could tell the government ""you're not having it"" over the Squire cash. He told her: ""We are busy discussing this with Transport Scotland and I prefer not to commit to a position yet."" Ms Grahame said: ""So the scheme might not go ahead because you've not decided 'Yes, we're going to do this'?"" Mr Verster replied: ""I can't vouch for whether the scheme goes ahead or not. I can just comment on whether we will make that decision, and when we'll make the decision in the next couple of weeks in terms of how we will deploy the Squire fund."" He said talks were ongoing about how the scheme would be funded, and said he had not thought of using the Squire money until it was suggested by the government. Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ""This is quite extraordinary. I was going to say this is policy made on the back of a fag packet, but I don't think it's even reached that stage of development."" Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles said he had assumed the Scottish government would be paying for the free fares scheme. He said: ""It's not new money that the Scottish government is using, it's money that you were going to invest in the railways."" He said it was ""completely inappropriate"" for the transport minister to ask for the money and it should up to Abellio ScotRail how to spend it, not the government. Mr Verster replied: ""We have a very constructive relationship with Transport Scotland and the Scottish government. A very open relationship. ""Now while we set may priorities of what we think would be best for customers, if Transport Scotland engages with us and makes alternative suggestions, of course we consider that. ""I don't think there's anything inappropriate about that. I think what is important is only one thing and that is customers in the end."" Mr Yousaf was also originally scheduled to give evidence to the committee, but this was postponed as he was unwell. A spokesman for the Scottish government said it ""remains absolutely committed"" to the scheme. He said: ""A free week's travel will be offered this year and further discounts for daily, weekly and leisure travellers. ""The ScotRail contract permits Squire funding to be directed to initiatives that improve the customer service experience, and we are currently negotiating the terms of the fares initiative with ScotRail through Transport Scotland, with the details expected to be finalised and announced in the coming weeks.""","The boss of ScotRail has told MSPs he cannot "" vouch"" for plans for free rail fares.",[],[],0

"The leaks from a secret BND report suggest that its monitoring station at Bad Aibling spied on France's presidential palace and foreign ministry, and the European Commission. The US National Security Agency also allegedly spied on some European firms. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere denies claims of a cover-up. The BND reportedly collected information on European firms at Washington's behest to check if they were breaking trade embargos. According to the reports, the BND did not target German or US officials in the surveillance, as they are protected by a BND-NSA agreement signed in 2002. However, it has emerged that the German government knew about NSA spying on European arms businesses as early as 2008. The government found ""shortcomings"" in the BND's operations, German TV reports. Minister under pressure - by the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin: . Yesterday the tabloid newspaper Bild printed a picture of Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere - his nose elongated to Pinocchio proportions. ""Herr de Maiziere!"" the accompanying headline screamed. ""You lie with impunity!"" There's outrage here that Germany - for so long seen as the victim of American espionage - may have helped US spies to target other Europeans. And pressure is building on the government to reveal how much it knew. As the former minister in charge of the chancellery, Thomas de Maiziere was directly responsible for Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, in 2008. And that is when, it's claimed, the BND first told the chancellery that its agents were now helping the NSA to spy on European aviation, aerospace and defence companies. Mr de Maiziere has denied all knowledge, and maintains that he hasn't deceived anyone. But he says that - because the information is all classified - he is unable to comment publicly. Yet there are questions about who else was aware. Another German newspaper devoted its front page to a ""wanted"" poster. Among the mugshots of politicians and civil servants was Chancellor Angela Merkel herself. Spy scandal turns tables on German government . Mr de Maiziere denies having had any knowledge of malpractice at German intelligence. But he called for the internal BND report to be presented to a parliamentary committee, ""the sooner the better"". The huge scale of NSA surveillance in Europe - including joint spying operations with the UK's GCHQ - was revealed in 2013 by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. There was outrage in Germany because of the scope of NSA spying, which allegedly included snooping on Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone conversations. The revelations strained German-US diplomatic ties. Last July Germany expelled a CIA official based at the US embassy, as reports surfaced of several Germans having spied for the NSA. Germany's leftist Die Linke party accused the German government on Wednesday of ""lying"" in connection with NSA activities.

"It comes after local media reported he had served time for molesting two girls under 10 in the late 1990s. The man and his wife took home only one baby from Thailand after the surrogate had twins, leaving behind son Gammy. The case has made international headlines, causing uproar in Australia. State authorities told the BBC they were now conducting a ""full investigation"" to assess the father's ""suitability"" to have a young child in his custody. A spokesman for Western Australia's department for child protection and family support told the BBC: ""Last night we were made aware of certain information by the police regarding allegations of the father's criminal background."" Asked if convicted sex offenders have been allowed to keep their children, the spokesman said they assess cases based on ""individual circumstances"". Besides Down's syndrome, the six-month-old baby has a congenital heart condition and a lung infection. Surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua has been looking after Gammy as well as two children of her own. She claims his parents abandoned Gammy and had asked her to have an abortion when she was told of the child's condition four months after becoming pregnant. Ms Chanbua, 21, has said the father met the twins, but only took care of the girl and refused to carry or look at Gammy even though the babies were side by side. The parents have told local media in Australia that they did not know of his existence, and claimed that the allegations made by Ms Chanbua are lies. But one local newspaper quoted a family friend saying the parents did know about the boy being born, apparently contradicting their version of events. ""Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,"" the friend said. She suggested Ms Chanbua, 21, had broken the surrogacy agreement by giving birth in a smaller hospital instead of an international one, which meant that the biological parents had no legal rights to the babies. The couple had been locked in a legal battle with Ms Chanbua to take home their daughter and she had insisted on keeping Gammy to give him a Thai funeral, the friend alleged. Both the Australian government and Thai health authorities are now looking into the case and the larger issue of commercial surrogacy in Thailand, which is mostly unregulated.

"Scientists carried out a series of experiments to assess the economic and ecological importance of the nocturnal insect-eating mammals to farmers. Globally, bat populations are under pressure as a result of habitat loss and the spread of diseases. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""The results of this study are a testament to the value of ecosystem services,"" said co-author Josiah Maine from Southern Illinois University. (Source: US Fish & Wildlife Service) Bats videos, news and facts from BBC Nature . In North America, many bat populations are under threat from a disease called White-Nose Syndrome. Since 2007, the disease has killed millions of bats and continues to spread. The US National Wildlife Health Centre estimated that bat populations in the north-east of the country have declined by about 80% since the first reported cases of bat fatalities as a result of the disease. It added: ""The true ecological consequences of large-scale population reductions currently underway among hibernating bats are unknown. However, farmers might feel the impact."" Mr Maine told BBC News that he was interested in finding out how effective bats were in terms of providing a pest control service to farmers growing corn (maize). The team constructed a number of exclosures (a controlled, open-air experimental area) measuring 20 metres by 20 metres and seven metres high, consisting of netting that was suspended by cables. ""This netting allowed the insects to move freely but prevented bats from foraging in those areas,"" He explained. ""We were only interested in excluding the bats so we constructed the exclosures so all the netting could be slid to one end so we could open them up during the day to allow birds to forage in the area."" Using the data gathered from the field study and combining with other previously published data, the team was able to extrapolate the findings to a global scale and estimate a monetary value for the ecological service provided by bats in terms of pest control in cornfields. The team wrote: ""We estimate that the suppression of herbivory by insectivorous bats is worth more than US$1bn globally on this crop alone."" Mr Maine told BBC News: ""Bear in mind that this figure does not take into account for the impacts of bats on the fungal diseases we found in the corn, or the micro-toxins produced by those fungal species. ""It also does not account for the reduced amount of pesticides used in fields, as bats could be providing an additional valuable service to agriculture by suppressing pest populations below the threshold where pesticides are necessary."" Farmers' friend . According to the IUCN's Bat Specialist Group (BSG), bat species account for one fifth of all terrestrial mammals. As well as being an important predator of insects, bats are also considered to be key seed dispersers and pollinators for many plants. Yet, the BSG observed: ""They are among the most endangered of the world's creatures, primarily because much of their habitat has been eliminated by human development or because they are persecuted. ""Their loss has serious consequences for the ecosystems to which they belong."" An earlier study, publish in Science in April 2011, warned that the loss of bat species in North America could lead to agricultural losses in the region of US$3.7bn each year. The authors observed: ""Urgent efforts are needed to educate the public and policymakers about the ecological and economic importance of insectivorous bats and to provide practical conservation solutions."" Mr Maine echoed this view: ""Bats are maligned in the media and there is a public fear, so if we can demonstrate a valuable, positive impact of bats then it is good for the species and it is good for society. ""What it suggests is that conservation is necessary not just from an ethical stance but from an economic standpoint as well.""","Bats are worth more than US$1bn (£640m) a year in terms of pest control for corn crops, a study suggests.","['The summary states that bats are worth £640m a year in terms of pest control, but the source text does not mention this figure or provide a conversion from US$1bn to £640m.']","['The summary states that bats are worth more than US$1bn a year, but the source text does not specify that this value is annual; it only states the global worth of pest control for corn crops.

"Instead of the familiar 0700 jingle-and-bulletin that got us moving kettlewards, listeners to the news channel France-Info have had to endure 21 days of recorded messages and music. Non-striking journalists periodically manage to put together short sequences on the station, but it is a pale shadow of the real thing. Masses of listeners are defecting to private channels such as RMC and Europe 1. And there is the same empty airtime on the six other channels that operate from Maison de la Radio in Paris (France Inter, France Bleu, France Culture, France Musique, FIP and Le Mouv'). No-one can remember a strike at Radio France lasting this long, because no strike ever has. There is a reason for that. For decades Radio France has enjoyed the status of a cosseted state asset. Constantly lauded - its mission of public service placing it above reproach - the corporation never felt the stern hand of reform. But now the country's coffers are empty. There is no more buying off the protest with a sneaky handout from the culture ministry. Today the years of accumulated waste and inefficiencies cry out for an overhaul. A report a couple of weeks ago from the French treasury watchdog, the Cour des Comptes, showed the scale of the problem. From 2004 to 2013, expenditure at Radio France went up 27.5% - with no increase in audience. Salary costs went up by 47% because at a time of growing pressure on jobs everywhere else Radio France took on 20% more staff. Because of the layers of accumulated privileges (often negotiated with unions after previous strikes), the 5,000 workers enjoy up to 68 working days off a year - more than 13 weeks. There are 388 staff members who are paid union representatives - a whopping 8% of the workforce. Renovation of Radio France's landmark Seine-side headquarters was supposed to cost 262m euros (Â£191m, $285m). Instead it is costing 575m euros. Changing all this requires a mix of vision, toughness and dialogue, but the man whose job it is might have been purpose-picked to antagonise the unions. Radio France's new president Mathieu Gallet is handsome, young, energetic - and right-wing. One of his previous jobs was in the culture ministry under President Nicholas Sarkozy. Mr Gallet has warned that the corporation's annual deficit of 21m euros is unsustainable. He wants a voluntary redundancy plan to shed 300 or so jobs. He says that Radio France's two orchestras are one too many; that the separate news rooms at France Inter, France Info and France Culture need to be integrated; and that the network of local stations at France Bleu should commission shared material. But all this has merely infuriated the unions at Radio France. The hardliners there mainly represent technicians, although many journalists have also stopped work. The strikers have made it quite clear that they want Mr Gallet to go. And usefully they have discovered that even as he was advising drastic cuts at the corporation, he spent 100,000 euros doing up his personal office there. It is the sort of gaffe that could easily have brought him down. But so far Mr Gallet continues with the backing of the Socialist government, which presumably sees as well as he does the inevitability of reform. For those of us who depended on France-Info's round-the-clock news output, it is an infuriating time. Though the station has a discernible left-wing bias - the ratio of union leaders to company bosses interviewed must be about five to one - it is in general thorough and professional. It is also, by comparison with private stations, mercifully light on adverts (though, for all its vaunted public sector ethos, Radio France does permit some). The danger is that we news junkies will start looking elsewhere, and discovering the competition.",The strike at Radio France is taking its toll.,[],[],0
"The organisations behind the complaint say it is the biggest constitutional complaint in German history. They say the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) deal violates democratic principles and will give too much power to multinational companies. But the German economy minister says a ruling in favour of the petitioners would be ""a catastrophe"". The Constitutional Court in the south-western city of Karlsruhe is due to rule on the emergency appeal on Thursday. The deal has already been agreed after years of negotiations - but if this petition is successful, correspondents say, it is extremely unlikely to be signed as scheduled at the end of October. Protests in Germany against transatlantic TTIP and Ceta trade deals . EU Commission refuses to revise Canada Ceta trade deal . Belgian province may sink EU-Canada trade deal . Three activist groups gathered more than 125,000 signatures which they passed to the court in 70 boxes of documents in August. They are Compact, Foodwatch and More Democracy. Their legal objection to the deal is that parts of it can come into force even before national parliaments have ratified it, thus breaching the German constitution. ""Not a single parliament elected by me - neither the Bundestag nor the European Parliament - was given a mandate to negotiate for Ceta,"" says Roman Huber of More Democracy. Its most visible opponent on Tuesday was German Economy Minister and Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel. He has already battled to win his Social Democratic Party (SPD) round to the deal. He told the court that a successful challenge to Ceta would undermine Germany's credibility, reported Die Welt news website. ""I do not want to imagine what that could mean for Europe,"" he told the court. Activists fear that the deals could water down European standards in the key areas of workers' rights, public health and the environment. They say it will open up new areas for privatisation and give corporations new powers to make profits. They say it would give corporations the ability to sue governments through a special corporate court if they try to implement policies or regulations that could reduce the profits a company is expecting to make - for example, by increasing the minimum wage. Opponents also point to the complexity of the deal - suggesting that many deputies won't have read the 1,500-page document in full. Some argue that Ceta will allow many of the provisions in TTIP - the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal between the US and Europe - in through the back door. In August, Mr Gabriel was among leading European politicians who acknowledged that opposition meant the TTIP deal was effectively dead in the water. The court in Karlsruhe is due to rule on Thursday. If it rejects the complaints, European ministers are scheduled to approve the deal on 18 October, paving the way for it to be signed at a summit with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on 27 October. But if it fails the whole process could be upended, Mr Gabriel and Ceta opponents such as the Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern agree. Some, such as the head of Germany's Left party Katja Kipping, argue that the scale of opposition to Ceta is such that a reconsideration of the deal is warranted even if the court dismisses this complaint.

"Almost none of these will work. Why? Because, on current polling, it all comes down to whether you think the people voting for Andy Burnham or those voting for Yvette Cooper are more likely to put Corbyn as their next preference. And there is no decent publicly available evidence that either of them are. Furthermore, for similar reasons, there is no arithmetic reason why non Corbyn candidates withdrawing would do anything to stop Corbyn. Voters in this election will be given the opportunity to rank the candidates in order of preference. The first preferences are counted up, and the person with the fewest is eliminated from the contest - and the votes they received are given to whoever each person that voted for them rated as their second preference. If after that none of the candidates has achieved 50% of the vote, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated and their votes are given to whoever they put as their higher preference amongst the two remaining candidates. By definition, this gives one of the two remaining candidates a majority of the votes. Current polling puts Corbyn first, Cooper and Burnham roughly tied in second, and Kendall trailing in third. So either Cooper or Burnham will most likely be the candidate that faces Corbyn in the final round. If you want to stop Corbyn, you'll be voting for some combination of Cooper, Burnham and Kendall as your first three preferences. So your vote WILL end up being for whoever faces Corbyn in the final round, WHICHEVER order you put those three in. The only way you can affect the number of votes Corbyn gets is by trying to second-guess the second preferences of people that vote for eliminated candidates. If you believe the polls, Kendall's almost certain to be eliminated first, so you can't affect that. But one of Burnham and Cooper won't be eliminated before the final run off with Corbyn. Whichever one is eliminated will have their preferences redistributed to either Corbyn or his opponent. So, in theory, if you, the ""stop Corbyn"" voter thought that, say, Burnham's supporters are more likely to have Corbyn as their next preference than Cooper's, you should put Burnham ahead of Cooper in your preference list even if you ACTUALLY prefer Cooper to Burnham - because it'll starve Corbyn of the extra votes he'd get if Burnham was knocked out. The thing is, I am not aware of any decent evidence that this is the case. We have very few polls on the Labour leadership election - and those that exist (necessarily) have small samples of what Burnham and Cooper's second preferences would be. Very roughly speaking, the polling tables I've seen suggest supporters of both split their second preferences about 30/70 between Corbyn and his opponent. So it's not clear which of these you should give a higher preference to tactically stop Corbyn anyway. In other words, there is no obvious way to tactically vote against Corbyn. If you want to stop him he'll be your last preference anyway - and it literally doesn't matter what order your first three preferences are in. Crazy thought though it might be, you can happily vote for candidates on the basis of, y'know, how good you think they are. This actually has implications for people dropping out of the race as well. Ballot papers have already gone out, but Cooper could, for example, tell all her supporters to first preference Andy Burnham instead. In terms of tactical voting, there is NO POINT in any of the three non Corbyn candidates doing this. All their votes will be aggregated to support whoever faces Corbyn in the final round anyway as a result of the preference system. Of course, that's just on the arithmetic. There might be a case for candidates dropping out if they think that a unified anti-Corbyn campaign would be more effective at winning over existing Corbyn supporters - perhaps because they spend less time attacking each other. But this is necessarily pretty speculative, especially this late in the game.

"The law is to be changed in Spring 2017 to make directors personally liable for breaches of regulations. At the moment only firms can be fined for ignoring rules on cold calling, but many declare bankruptcy - only to open up again under a different name. Consumer group Which? said it was a ""massive victory"". Companies offering to help to reclaim mis-sold payment protection insurance or with accident claims are behind some of the most common nuisance calls. The change will mean the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) would be able to impose combined penalties of up to £1m on company directors and their businesses for breaches of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations. The ICO has issued fines totalling almost £3.7m to companies behind nuisance calls and spam text messages. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said companies behind the calls have ""little regard for the anxiety and upset they cause all in the name of turning a fast profit"".

"The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is believed to have deployed about 30,000 fighters. US-led coalition warplanes will support the offensive and Russia has also given its backing. The SDF did not mention any plan to take Raqqa, the de facto capital of the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS in 2014. The alliance, which is dominated by the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) militia, has emerged as a key ally of the US-led coalition over the past two years, leading the fight against IS on the ground in northern Syria. With the help of US airpower, it has taken control of about 26,000 sq km (10,000 sq miles) of territory, including a 400km (250 mile) stretch along the Turkish border. On Tuesday, SDF fighters were seen moving south from Tal Abyad near the Turkish border towards Ain Issa, a town about 60km (37 miles) north-west of Raqqa, according to UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Clashes were reported nearby, it added. SDF commander Rojda Felat wrote on Twitter that the goal of the new offensive was to ""liberate northern Raqqa"" and those living under IS ""oppression"". ""The campaign is aimed at repelling terrorist attacks on Shaddadi, Tal Abyad and Kobane, ensuring the security of our people,"" she added. An SDF source told the Kurdish news agency, Rudaw, that fighters would be ""advancing to the villages of Big Fatiseh, Small Fatiseh and Tishi, in order to clear them of [IS] militants first"". BBC Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville says IS fighters are digging in, ready for the assault. As well as defensive placements in Raqqa, they have constructed an extensive network of tunnels, he adds. A Baghdad-based spokesman for the US-led coalition, Col Steve Warren, said the SDF operation was aimed at ""putting pressure on Raqqa"", but not taking the city. The SDF fighters had so far met little resistance, he added. The anti-IS activist group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), reported that there had been air strikes on IS positions north of Raqqa on Tuesday, and that intense fighting had erupted around the village of Heisha. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said that Moscow was ready to co-ordinate with the SDF and the US on the offensive. The SDF's announcement followed a meeting between officials in the alliance and a top US commander in northern Syria on Saturday. Gen Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, made the secret trip to check on the 200 US military personnel who were advising the SDF on the ground. The US wants to increase the number of Arab fighters in the SDF, which currently consists of at least 25,000 Kurds and between 5,000 and 6,000 Arabs, before trying to retake Raqqa. Col Warren said about 3,000 to 5,000 IS fighters were inside Raqqa. IS seized the city in August 2013, five months after it became the first Syrian provincial capital to fall to rebel forces seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad.

"Journalist Ben Jacobs tweeted that Mr Gianforte had ""body slammed"" him, breaking his glasses. The front runner's campaign said that Mr Jacobs had initiated the incident by grabbing Mr Gianforte's wrist. But other journalists said they saw the reporter show no physical aggression. The incident took place on Wednesday, the eve of a special election to fill a vacant seat in the House of Representatives. The Guardian released an audio recording of the clash, in which crashing sounds can be heard when Mr Jacobs presses the candidate for a response to a question. Mr Gianforte then shouts ""I'm sick and tired of you guys"" and tells the reporter to ""get the hell out of here"". Alicia Acuna of Fox News was in the room with two colleagues preparing for a television interview with Mr Gianforte at the time. She said Mr Jacobs entered the room, put a voice recorder up to Mr Gianforte's face and asked about the Congressional Budget Office report on the American Health Care Act. When Mr Jacobs persisted, ""Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him"", she wrote. ""Faith, Keith and I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter. As Gianforte moved on top of Jacobs, he began yelling something to the effect of, ""I'm sick and tired of this!"", she added. ""At no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte,"" she said. Mr Jacobs later told MSNBC he then went to a hospital to have his elbow X-rayed, because he landed on it during the incident. He said he believed the campaign staff were unhappy about previous dealings with Guardian colleagues. Three of the state's largest newspapers, the Billings Gazette, the Helena Independent Record, and the Missoulian, have since their endorsements of Mr Gianforte. ""We are also sick and tired - of Gianforte's incessant attacks on the free press,"" said the Independent Record. The Missoulian noted that as the eyewitness report came from right-wing Fox News, the incident could not be construed as liberal ""fake news"". Mr Gianforte's campaign spokesman said Mr Jacobs entered the office without permission and ""aggressively shoved a recorder in Greg's face and began asking badgering questions"". The candidate, ""attempted to grab the phone"", then ""Jacobs grabbed Greg's wrist and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground"", Shane Scanlon wrote in a statement. ""It's unfortunate that this aggressive behaviour from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ,"" he added. Gallatin County Sheriff's Office said that after an investigation a citation was issued to Greg Gianforte on Wednesday night for misdemeanour assault. This is a lesser offence than felony assault, for which ""the nature of the injuries did not meet the statutory elements"", Sheriff Brian Gootkin said. The maximum penalty for the offence is a $500 (Â£385) fine and a six-month jail term. Records show that Sheriff Gootkin has donated $250 to Mr Gianforte's congressional campaign. The vacancy in Montana arose after President Donald Trump appointed the previous holder of the seat, Ryan Zinke, as interior secretary. Democrat Rob Quist, a banjo-playing folk singer and first-time candidate, is battling Mr Gianforte, a multimillionaire technology executive and Christian conservative. In Washington, California Republican congressman Duncan Hunter said it was not appropriate behaviour. ""Unless the reporter deserved it"", he reportedly added.

"The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said it will offer advice to women concerned about any symptoms after taking abortion medication. A spokesman said ""restrictive abortion laws"" on the island are forcing women to order pills over the internet. Anti-abortion campaigners have dismissed the helpline launch as a ""dangerous publicity stunt"". Although abortion it is not currently illegal on the island, the law states the procedure can only be carried out in the event of a criminal offence or on mental health grounds. According to the UK Department of Health, 105 women travelled from the Isle of Man to England in 2015 to terminate pregnancies. However, while most women from the UK can have an NHS-funded abortion, those from the island have to pay for both the procedure and travel expenses. BPAS spokesman Katherine O'Brien told the BBC that there are many who cannot afford to make the journey and are ""increasingly resorting to buying medication online."" ""We are concerned that, because they are committing an illegal act, women may not always seek help when they need it. ""It's really important they have access to the same follow up care and the same nurse led advice that all other women do"".

Mr Stuart's funeral will take place at Laurencekirk Parish Church before he is laid to rest at Laurencekirk Cemetery. A statement from his family said he was ""a good friend to many and will be greatly missed by all who knew him"". The maker of the helicopter that crashed has lifted its recommendation that the same type of aircraft be grounded worldwide. Airbus Helicopters said initial evidence suggested no link with two previous incidents in Scotland involving Super Puma H225 helicopters. The aircraft will remain grounded in the UK, however, as a Civil Aviation Authority flight ban remains in force. In 2012, two EC225 Super Puma helicopters ditched into the North Sea in Scotland - one off Aberdeen and another off Shetland. Both incidents were blamed on gearbox problems and all passengers and crew were rescued. EC225s in the UK were grounded following the incidents but given the go-ahead to resume flying in August 2013. Later that same month a different model of Super Puma, the AS332 L2, crashed off Shetland, killing four people.

"""Hairy Nose"" depicts a bleak future where people have evolved lengthy nasal hair to filter out the smog. It ends with a warning that if people don't change their ways, pollution will change them. The charity, WildAid, told the BBC they wanted people to stop waiting for government action to fix the problem. ""We wanted to find some humorous way to talk about the very serious problem we are facing,"" said WildAid's China representative, May Mei. Hairy Nose shows a parade of stylish Chinese people - and one dog - sporting elaborately groomed nasal hair as they go about their daily lives in the ""putrid, choking air and the never ending smog"". We see a a young family out with their hairy-nosed baby, a young commuter with her nasal hair dyed and plaited, hipsters playing pool and a couple on a date. ""To them, this is just the way it is,"" say the captions. But one man decides not to ""blindly submit"" and shaves off his nose hair so he can breathe, ""because it reminds me that the sky once was blue"". ""Change air pollution before it changes you,"" says the final caption. Ms Mei said WildAid wanted to tell people to stop waiting for the government to take action on pollution and climate change, and instead come up with their own creative ways to be more green. ""A lot of people complain about pollution in Beijing and Shanghai, but no-one really knows what you can do,"" she said. ""What we want to say is that change is not that difficult, it should come from everyone."" She suggested that 35% of Beijing's pollution comes from transport fumes, so cycling or walking would make a real difference. The campaign is targeting mostly young Chinese, particularly internet users, because they are ""willing to change, to accept new ideas and are also prepared for something better"". China, which is reliant on coal-fuelled power stations, is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Pollution levels in major cities routinely reach levels considered dangerous to human health. A report last year, published in Nature, put the number of annual deaths in China attributable to pollution at 1.3 million. WildAid clearly doesn't expect people to take its hairy nose warning literally, but Ms Mei said they hoped it would make people ""think harder"". ""If you're waiting to change your actions, you will eventually be forced to live not in the way you want,"" she said.",A global environmental charity has launched a social media campaign in China aimed at highlighting the issue of air pollution.,"['The summary states that the charity is a global environmental charity, but the text does not describe WildAid as a global organization.

"It is a relationship that these days may be closer to a case of gritting one's teeth rather than a smile, at least when it comes to trade. As it is for most countries in Asia, China is North Korea's biggest trading partner. Except that of course that there's one major difference: North Korea would completely collapse without China's economic help. That's why the US has been persuading Beijing to help the international community ensure that the new round of sanctions would hit North Korea where it hurts - cutting off access to Pyongyang's biggest customer is one way to send a powerful message. The latest sanctions - imposed because of North Korea's nuclear programme - aims to cut its coal exports to China by 60%. But there have been international sanctions and censure in place before, and despite those measures, China has continued to buy products from North Korea. Chinese companies buy North Korean coal and textiles, for example, while at the same time selling food, arms and energy to Pyongyang. Partly this is out of an allegiance to an old but volatile ally, but also partly out of a desire to ensure the balance of power in the region is tipped in Beijing's favour. Many analysts say China's refusal to play ball means that the sanctions strategy isn't working. But as Gordon Chang, author of ""The Coming Collapse of China"" tells me, it's not that the sanctions on North Korea haven't been working - ""it's that China doesn't get punished when it doesn't implement the sanctions"". While it's true that in recent years China hasn't been particularly strict about enforcing sanctions on North Korea, there's some evidence to show that trade between the two neighbours is slowing. China's trade with North Korea has been falling this year, some 13% from a year earlier according to data in May from the Korea International Trade Association. Exports were down 15.6%, while Beijing's imports fell by 9.8%. But Mr Chang points out that this is as much about the slowing of China's economy as it is about sanctions. ""Demand for commodities has slowed, and China is buying less of everything,"" he said. ""And it's not that big a sacrifice for China - it doesn't really need this coal anyway."" In an article for the Conversation website, Kelvin Gray of the University of Sussex said that even if coal exports fall ""one area where North Korea has kept its exports [to China] healthy is clothing"". Machines and raw materials are sold to North Korea from a Chinese company, the North Koreans provide the labour, (probably for a fraction of the price it would cost in China) and then the finished goods end up back in China. The profits that the North Korean regime makes from this sort of trade is difficult to calculate - but it is almost certainly in the hundreds of millions. It's a relationship that Beijing is unlikely to sever - and not for the usual argument that you hear about North Korean refugees flooding the Chinese border should the state collapse - at least, not according to Mr Chang. ""The first place North Koreans would go if the country were to collapse wouldn't be China, it would be South Korea,"" he said. ""The real reason why China keeps the North Korean state alive economically is because it whenever Pyongyang fires off another test, Washington comes running to Beijing for help."" Mr Chang adds that this is a position China likes and wants to keep. And, he says, that unless Washington starts punishing Beijing for not enforcing these rules, this round of sanctions is unlikely to have much of an effect either.",The relationship between China and North Korea is one of the closest in the world.,"['The summary states that the relationship between China and North Korea is one of the closest in the world, but the text describes the relationship as strained, with China reluctantly supporting North Korea for strategic reasons rather than closeness.']",[],0
"Official data do not include emissions from making imported goods but both sets of researchers say they should. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports 26% of global emissions come from producing goods for trade. The Carbon Trust found such ""embedded"" CO2 could negate domestic carbon cuts planned in the UK up to 2025. Researchers want all nations to publish their data on embedded emissions. Glen Peters of research group Cicero, lead authors of the PNAS report, told BBC News: ""There is a degree of delusion about emissions cuts in developed nations. They are not really cuts at all if countries are simply buying in products they used to manufacture. ""We really need all countries to be developing and publishing the full extent of their emissions, whether they are produced domestically or outsourced through traded goods."" The issue of embedded (or outsourced) carbon emissions has been recognised for several years, and the methodology to track emissions pathways is developing. Cicero produced a trade-linked global database for CO2 emissions covering 113 countries and 57 economic sectors from 1990 to 2008. It found that emissions from producing exported goods increased from 4.3Gt (gigatonnes) of CO2 in 1990 (20% of global emissions) to 7.8Gt of CO2 in 2008 (26%). Most developed countries increased their consumption-based emissions faster than their territorial emissions - particularly from goods such cars and clothes. The Carbon Trust research confirms that the UK has increased emissions since 1990 rather than decreasing them, as politicians typically claim. What may alarm ministers even more is a projection that the radical CO2 cuts planned by government into the 2020s may be offset by ever-increasing levels of CO2 in imports. Dr Peters said: ""Publishing this sort of data is the first step. The next step - what to do about it - is more difficult. ""It raises questions about consumption patterns, and whether countries should consider border taxes on imports from countries with no controls on CO2 emissionsâ€¦ though this is controversial and will be some way down the line."" A UK think tank, the Public Interest Research Centre (Pirc), has been discovering how uncomfortable this issue is proving for rich nations. A succession of Freedom of Information requests reveals a degree of frustration among some British civil servants that the UK insists on basing its emissions calculations solely on domestic emissions. One piece of government correspondence reveals: ""While technological efficiency has improved the CO2 impacts of our products since 1992, the rise in UK consumption has outstripped the improvements achieved. ""The government needs to be cautious about over-claiming on its achievements in decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation."" Ministers are well aware of the issue, but insist that the UK should stick to reporting domestic emissions, as these form the basis for international climate negotiations. They also point out that emissions data from major exporters like China is notoriously opaque, and that the methodology for calculating outsourced emissions is unreliable. They say all this creates even greater pressure for the UK to persuade China to cut its own emissions. Guy Shrubsole, from Pirc, told BBC News: ""This is a cop-out. The figures aren't perfect but the problem has been recognised for several years and the calculations are getting better all the time. In the UK our emissions are up - not down. ""Of course China needs to be part of a global climate agreement. But for a government which wants to be the greenest ever and is committed to data transparency it's essential that the British government publishes the best data available right away - and then figures out what to do about it.""","Carbon emissions from making imported goods are increasing, according to two separate reports.",[],"['The summary states that carbon emissions from making imported goods are increasing, but the text does not explicitly state this.

"Wokingham Borough Council served a High Court injunction on travellers for setting up ""unauthorised"" pitches and an access road on the private land. The Gypsy Council said the authority had been quick to get an injunction but refused to provide enough gypsy sites. The council said it ""utterly refutes"" the accusation of racism. Housing applications in the area had been judged acceptable against the borough's planning policies, drawn up following a statutory process including consultation, it said. Caravans arrived on the Berkshire site on 24 April with the permission of the landowner, who is part of the gypsy community. But the council has taken legal action because developments that have since taken place do not have planning consent. It obtained the injunction to prevent further caravans and development on the Berkshire site, after its deadline to exit the site by Monday 27 April was ignored. ""This is not a site allocated for development in the council's local plan,"" said director of environment, Helen Thwaites. ""It is located within the countryside where the council's policies seek to protect the rural character."" Residents near the site, in Blagrove Lane, have also expressed concern.

"Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia won 16 of 22 cities with the anti-immigration Northern League and another party. The results were a setback for Matteo Renzi, the former centre-left prime minister seeking to return to power as head of the Democratic Party (PD). ""It could have gone better,"" he admitted in a social media post. The PD currently heads a coalition led by Paolo Gentiloni, who took over after Mr Renzi lost a referendum on electoral reform in December 2016. The biggest defeats for the PD were in party strongholds such as Genoa, La Spezia and L'Aquila. The centre-right also won in other provincial capitals including Monza, Piacenza and Pistoia. Mr Berlusconi, 80, will now set his sights on the next general election, which is due in 2018 but may take place earlier. Silvio Berlusconi may hope that 80 is the new 40. The gains made by his Forza Italia party in local elections allow him to claim the start of yet another political comeback. ""From these results the centre-right can set on a path to go back to ruling the country,"" he said in a statement. But there is a major road-block in the way of his return for a fourth time as prime minister: he is currently banned from holding political office. The ban, imposed following a 2013 conviction for tax fraud, doesn't expire until 2019. Unless he wins an early appeal at the European Court of Human Rights, Mr Berlusconi won't be able to run in Italy's 2018 general election.

Out of office in 1994, he then returned for a five-year period in 2001 and again in 2008 for three more years. His political career has been overshadowed by his legal battles, which culminated in a community service sentence for tax fraud.

"Anti-smoking groups say that is too long to wait, but there have been protests by some restaurant owners, who say their business will suffer. Austrians like order, or ""Ordnung"" as they say in German. It is hugely frowned upon for a pedestrian to cross the road on a red light. And the streets and underground network of Vienna are kept remarkably clean. But smoky air in cafes and restaurants has been widely tolerated for years. ""Smoking is a sort of culture, especially in Austria,"" Margit Schwed told me as she sat in Cafe Ritter in Vienna, with its gilt chandeliers and marble table tops. ""In the typical Vienna Kaffeehaus you take your coffee and your cigarette. I think people like the flair in the coffee houses."" Austria has one of the highest rates of smoking in Europe, particularly among young people: 33% of Austrians smoke regularly, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer study. Only Greeks, Bulgarians and Latvians smoke more. A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 27% of Austrian 15-year-olds smoke at least once a week, more frequently than any other children in the OECD area. Several years ago, when many countries had already banned smoking in bars and cafes, Austria first adopted the idea of introducing separate smoking and non-smoking areas. Small restaurants could choose whether to go smoke-free or not. Larger restaurants, like Cafe Ritter, were obliged to provide a separate smoking section, sealed off by glass partitions. The law was heavily criticised by doctors and anti-smoking groups as half-hearted and badly enforced. Earlier this year, after the death of a prominent anti-smoking journalist from lung cancer, Austria's coalition government of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party announced plans to bring in a total ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018. ""We have finally arrived in Europe with anti-smoking protection,"" Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser said. However there were protests from the far-right Freedom Party and from Austria's Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce opposes the ban, because it says restaurants and cafes invested around â‚¬100m ($109m; Â£714m) to install ventilation systems and glass partitions to accommodate the separate smoking areas. The economy minister, Reinhold Mitterlehner, has said their interests will be taken into account.

"The image, a parody of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring, was found on Hanover Place near the city's harbour. Girl with a Pierced Eardrum incorporates an alarm box as the model's earring. On Tuesday, the work was found with dark paint thrown across the bottom of the woman's face. Banksy's last work in the city was Mobile Lovers, which appeared in a doorway in Clement Street in April. A row broke out over who owned it, with Bristol City Council arguing the work was on its land. However, Banksy wrote to Broad Plain Boys' Club saying it was theirs and the club sold it to a private collector for Â£403,000. But the anonymous graffiti artist's new mural is not the first to have been vandalised in his home town. In 2009, red paint was thrown over Mild Mild West on Stokes Croft prompting calls for the piece - one of Banksy's most famous - to be protected with a clear plastic covering. And months later the Hanging Man, at the bottom of Park Street, was damaged with blue paint. Both pieces were successfully restored. But one work that could not be saved was painted close to the Bristol Royal Infirmary.

"Parents Chris Gard and Connie Yates have launched a final legal challenge at the European Court of Human Rights after a Supreme Court challenge failed. European judges said doctors were required to keep the 10-month-old alive until they had passed judgement. Specialists at Great Ormond Street believe he has no chance of survival. Charlie has been in intensive care in hospital since October last year. His doctors said he cannot hear, move, cry or swallow and that his lungs only go up and down because he is on a machine that does it for him. Judges in Strasbourg, France, had previously ruled an interim measure to keep him alive should remain in place until midnight on 19 June. The new extension lasts until a final ruling is made. A spokesperson said the court ""will treat the application with the utmost urgency"" but have not indicated when the final judgement will be made. Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, have raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for an experimental treatment in the US. In April a High Court judge ruled against the trip to America and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity.

"The skeleton was unearthed during a large-scale excavation of the Swinegate area of York in 1990. The York Archaeological Trust (YAT) said more than 100 burial sites were discovered, many dating from between the 9th and 11th Century. The skeleton and coffin are being displayed at the city's Jorvik Viking Centre. York was occupied by the Vikings from the late 9th Century until the middle of the 10th Century, when it was absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of England. The Swinegate dig explored the churchyard of the former church of St Benet, which had stood on the site from the 8th to the early 14th Century. Unusually, a number of timber coffins had survived. Sarah Maltby, director of attractions for the trust, said: ""As we found in the Coppergate dig of the late 1970s, York's waterlogged soil conditions preserved the timber of several coffins, including this one, so what our archaeologists unearthed represents a series of previously undisturbed burials with complete skeletons, some of which date back more than 1,000 years."" She said the condition of the wood gave the coffin a national significance, as so few similar examples exist. The coffin was made for a young woman, estimated at being between 26 and 35 at her death, and dates from the late Viking period. The YAT said recent analysis of the bones revealed the woman had inadequate nutrition or disease as a child and a degenerative joint disease in the spine and hips. There was no indication of what caused her death.","A Viking coffin dating back more than 1,000 years has gone on display.",[],"['The summary states the coffin is a Viking coffin, but the text does not describe the coffin as Viking, only that it dates from the late Viking period.', 'The summary states the coffin dates back more than 1,000 years, but the text specifies it dates from the late Viking period, which is less than 1,000 years ago.']",0
"Since April, convicted criminals in England and Wales have had to pay a charge of between £150 and £1,200 towards the cost of their case. But Mr Gove said ""while the intention behind the policy was honourable in reality that intent has fallen short"". MPs had called for it to be axed and the Magistrates Association said the decision was ""tremendously welcome"". The charge is paid on top of fines, compensation orders and defendants' own legal charges, and is higher for those convicted after pleading not guilty. It is set according to the type of case, with the minimum charge for magistrates' courts and the maximum level for crown court cases. In March, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the fee would ensure that criminals ""pay their way"". But MPs on the Justice Committee published a report in November in which they said the fee, which is not means-tested, created ""serious problems"" and was often ""grossly disproportionate"". The cross-party group's chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said they evidence they had received raised ""grave misgivings"" about the fee's benefits and whether it was ""compatible with the principles of justice"". He said it created ""perverse incentives - not only for defendants to plead guilty but for sentencers to reduce awards of compensation and prosecution costs"". Mr Gove, Mr Grayling's successor as justice secretary, announced it was being dropped, during a meeting of the Magistrates' Association Council. The Magistrates' Association's national chairman, Malcolm Richardson said: ""This is an enormous success for the MA (Magistrates' Association) but most importantly for justice in our criminal courts system. ""In my 26 years as a magistrate I have never seen such a powerful reaction from my colleagues on the bench and Michael Gove's announcement is therefore tremendously welcome."" Justice Select Committee chairman Bob Neill said it was ""good"" Mr Gove was ""willing to respond so swiftly to take account of the inquiry we carried out and the evidence submitted to us"". ""We will watch with interest the review which Michael Gove has announced into the whole panoply of financial impositions on offenders,"" he added. The Howard League for Penal Reform - which has called for the fee policy to be suspended - also welcomed the news, saying the charge was ""simply unfair"". Its chief executive, Frances Crook said: ""This is a victory for justice. It augurs well for changes being made to the courts and penal systems, which both need radical reform."" Meanwhile, Labour said it had warned from the start that the ""mandatory nature of the fee could lead to miscarriages of justice"" and welcomed that it ""has finally been scrapped"". Mr Gove told Parliament in November that the charge was generating revenue and helping to ""ensure that the taxpayer is not the first port of call for supporting the way in which our courts operate, but it is important that we balance all the criteria in making a judgment on the review of the charge"".","A controversial criminal prosecution fee is to be scrapped, Justice Secretary Michael Gove has announced.","['The summary states the fee ""is to be scrapped,"" but the text indicates that Michael Gove announced it ""was being dropped,"" implying the decision has already been made and is not a future action.']",[],0
"Donald Trump's running mate, a long-time opponent of Planned Parenthood, will be sent a gift certificate for every donation. The campaign began in 2011 when as an Indiana congressman he introduced several anti-abortion measures. They included the first bill to strip the provider of all federal funding. Tears as a soldier from Iraq's Mosul finds his mum on a bus . Close encounter with the moon . The tricks on Trump Joe Biden might be planning - in memes . In March this year, as Indiana governor, Mr Pence signed an anti-abortion bill that is seen as one of the most restrictive in the US, barring abortion in Indiana on the basis of disability, gender or race of the foetus. Parts of that law were blocked by the courts, but not until after a social media backlash which saw women phoning or tweeting Mr Pence details about their menstrual cycles under the hash tag #periodsforpence. There had already been a significant rise in gifts to the country's biggest abortion provider in the wake of Mr Trump's election last week. But then over the weekend, many women went on social media to say they had made a donation in Mike Pence's name. Mike Pence's anti-abortion stance mirrors that of President-elect Trump, who wants to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, and who has in the past said women should be punished for undergoing an abortion if it were made illegal, though he later withdrew the statement. What is Planned Parenthood? Who is Indiana Governor Mike Pence? What Donald Trump is planning on abortion . 'Hello governor, I have my period' Planned Parenthood hasn't commented in detail on the post-election trend of donating in Mr Pence's honour.

"They have been removed to stop the spread of ash dieback, a fungal disease that can infect mature trees and saplings. Scientists have warned that if it is not contained it could change the landscape and affect our biodiversity. It has been found on around 100 sites in Northern Ireland. All those sites were planted with imported saplings, some of which had the infection. Infected ash trees were destroyed along with any others planted alongside. That led to the removal of 100,000 young trees. The disease is widespread in Europe where it is killing mature trees. In Northern Ireland, it is mostly in saplings planted within the past five years. It spreads on the wind by spores. Scientists at the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) in Belfast are trying to establish if that is happening in Northern Ireland yet. Prof Alistair McCracken, a plant pathologist with AFBI, said: ""This is a serious disease. In Denmark they say up to 90% of the ash trees have been infected. ""Now they haven't all died, but they have been affected and are looking quite sickly so potentially this could have a huge impact on the Northern Ireland environment."" Infected ash trees will not recover, although mature trees can survive for a long time. The fungus appears between June and September on leaf litter. Each pinhead size fungus can produce large numbers of spores. When they land on a fresh ash leaf they germinate, penetrate the surface and grow into the stem. The first symptom is wilting leaves. As it gets worse the trees will develop a diamond-shaped dark-coloured lesion on the bark. In Denmark, Sweden and east European countries, where the disease has been present for 30 years, large numbers of trees have become infected. Scientists are worried about its impact in Northern Ireland, where ash is a common tree. They are carrying out a survey of more than 1,000 sites to identify any further problems. And they have asked for the public's help. The authorities have developed a smartphone app called Tree Check that the public can use to report potential problems, including a picture and a GPS position. They will then be assessed and, if necessary, the site visited by experts. Jim Crummie, plant health expert with the Forest Service urged the public to download the app and to be the ""eyes and ears"" of the authorities in the fight to combat the disease. Tree Check can be used to report all tree diseases, not just ash dieback.",Tens of thousands of young ash trees have been destroyed across Northern Ireland.,[],[],0

"The company wants to extract shale gas at Little Plumpton and Roseacre Wood on the Fylde Coast. In June, the council rejected both planning applications, after fracking was suspended in the UK in 2011. The company said ""a natural step"" would now be to appeal. Cuadrilla said the council's planning officer ""had recommended approval of the Preston New Road site"" at Little Plumpton ""and was very clear that the proposals were acceptable in relation to noise and visual impacts."". Its chief executive, Francis Egan, said: ""We have given careful consideration to appeal the planning decisions taken by Lancashire County Council. This is a natural step in the democratic process for deciding any planning application."" He added: ""We recognise that onshore shale gas exploration still feels relatively new in the UK and we remain committed to engaging with local communities to reassure them that exploratory operations can and will be carried out safely and in an environmentally responsible way."" The company was granted planning permission for monitoring works around the proposed site at Roseacre Wood, but said it would appeal against certain conditions that were imposed. The appeals on monitoring works are expected to be submitted within the next week, and the shale gas exploration site appeals will ""follow in due course,"" the company said. Fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - was suspended in the UK in 2011 following earth tremors in Blackpool where Cuadrilla previously drilled. It is a technique in which water and chemicals are pumped into shale rock at high pressure to extract gas. Friends of the Earth campaigner Furqan Naeem said: ""Cuadrilla's decision to appeal Lancashire's Council's resounding 'no' to controversial fracking shows a blatant disregard for the views of local people and local democracy. ""Lancashire councillors and residents have rejected fracking and the government's recent report revealing potential negative impacts on everything from the health of residents, to house prices, to climate change shows they were right to do so.""

The sperm whales are believed to be from a pod spotted off the Norfolk coast. The fifth whale was found at Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, on Monday afternoon, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency reported. It was found on the site of a former bombing range, and warnings have been issued for people to stay away. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust tweeted: ""There is no public access to the area and it is extremely dangerous with tidal creeks and the potential for unexploded ordinance.

"The taxi-app firm said the sackings related to sexual harassment, bullying and issues about poor company culture. Uber has been under fire over its treatment of women staff since a former employee wrote a scathing blog post about her experience. It led to two investigations and the uncovering of 215 complaints about harassment and other allegations. Uber has struggled with a series of controversies in recent months, including a backlash over aggressive corporate tactics and a lawsuit from Google-owner Alphabet over allegedly stolen technology for self-driving cars. Several high-placed executives resigned amid the turbulence, including a former head of engineering, who had failed to disclose harassment complaints at his former employer. Chief executive Travis Kalanick's filmed argument with an Uber driver over falling rates also fuelled criticism, leading him to say that he needed ""leadership help"". Susan Fowler, who wrote the critical blog post about Uber, said the company had ignored her complaints of sexual harassment. Widely shared, the blog prompted Mr Kalanick to launch the investigations. Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley . Law firm Perkins Coie reviewed 215 claims, which included sexual harassment and discrimination as well as other complaints, an Uber spokeswoman said. The firm recommended no action in 100 of them; 57 remain under review, while others have received warnings or are in training, she said. Some of those fired held senior positions, she said. Discrimination, 54; Sexual harassment, 47; Unprofessional behaviour, 45; Bullying, 33; Other harassment, 19; Retaliation, 13; Physical security 3; Wrongful dismissal 1. Staff fired, 20; Staff put in training, 31; Final warnings, 7; Claims still under review, 57. Uber has also appointed Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under former US president Barack Obama, to investigate the company's broader culture. The findings of that report have been turned over to the board and recommendations are expected to be made public next week. Some changes are already in place. Uber announced the hiring of two women to high profile positions this week. Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor, will serve as a senior vice president for leadership and strategy, working with the head of human resources Liane Hornsey. Ms Hornsey is herself relatively new, starting at the company in January. Bozoma Saint John, a former marketing executive at Apple, is also joining Uber as chief brand officer. Uber employs more than 12,000 people globally. About 36% of the workforce is female, according to a diversity report the firm published earlier this year. Women hold about 15% of the technology positions. It goes without saying that this issue doesn't go away with these firings. Uber has major questions still to answer - some of them will hopefully be addressed when more details of the report are made public. Most troubling is why Uber's own internal HR measures weren't thorough or fair enough to see that the actions of 20 employees warranted dismissal. Instead it took a brave former employee - and then an expensive, lengthy investigation - to get to that point. So as well as detailing what it has done to address those existing complaints, Uber will now have to be very clear about how it will handle such issues in future. Crucially, the lessons from this report should not be heeded by Uber alone.

"They think it could be used to improve nutritional advice or in weight loss because people are notoriously bad at recording their own eating habits. The test, detailed in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, detects chemicals made as food is processed by the body. The research team believe it could be widely available within two years. The urine samples are analysed to determine the structure of the chemicals floating around in it using a technique called a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This gives clues to both recent meals and long term dietary habits. The results of your body processing fruit, vegetables, fish and different types of meat leave a distinct signature in the urine. Clues to the state of the body's metabolism and gut health can also be detected by investigating the chemicals in it. The test was developed by a collaboration between Imperial College London, Newcastle University and Aberystwyth University. Dr Isabel Garcia-Perez, one of the researchers at Imperial, said: ""This will eventually provide a tool for personalised dietary monitoring to help maintain a healthy lifestyle. ""We're not at the stage yet where the test can tell us a person ate 15 chips yesterday and two sausages, but it's on the way."" In trials, around 60% of people either under or over report what they are eating. Prof Gary Frost, another scientist at Imperial, said this could be the first independent test of what people munch on at home. He told the BBC News website: ""You can really tell whether someone's been following a healthy diet or not. ""The bigger you are the more likely you are to under-report what you eat. ""People find it difficult to open up to what types of foods they eat at home, which is a major problem."" The researchers believe the test results could help combat people's obesity or risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Prof Frost said: ""If someone is very big and their profile says they're eating lots of energy dense foods like meat, then you can try to change that profile and then test them again later. ""It remains to be seen, but people might respond better to that and there is a desperate need for tools to help people change their diet."" He says doing the test on large numbers of people would build up a picture of what the nation was really eating, which could be used to design better public health campaigns. The scientists were able to spot the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets after tests on 19 people who spent days eating a carefully controlled set of meals. Four diets of varying degrees of healthiness were given to the patients and their urine was sampled morning, noon and night. Dr Des Walsh, from the UK Medical Research Council, commented: ""Though this research is still in its early stages, it's grappling with essential methods in food and diet studies where advances are really needed.

The move follows an investigation by the BBC and its US partners into Dapp Malawi, the Malawian branch of charity Development Aid from People to People. Dapp is one of the major NGOs active in Malawi, providing a range of aid projects from farming to health and education. The BBC found that part of the funding it received found its way to the Teachers Group, with some Dapp staff handing over as much as 30% of their monthly salary to the group. Founded in the 1970s, for years the Teachers Group has run a government-funded alternative school system, but in 2001 the Danish authorities raided its offices and charged its founder Mogens Amdi Petersen with fraud. Found not guilty in 2006, he and some of his associates immediately left the country, but prosecutors appealed and the group are now wanted by Interpol. It is thought they may have taken refuge in a massive luxury compound, worth an estimated Â£20m, on the Pacific coast in Mexico.

The White House appears to be girding for war against those investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any connections to the Trump campaign. Chances are this more aggressive posture, including a presidential feud with Mr Sessions - who served in the US Senate for 20 years - will only make matters worse, however. Like a person trapped in quicksand, the more the president struggles, the deeper he sinks. Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling it a ""witch hunt"". The South Carolina Republican announced he was creating a measure aimed at protecting Mr Mueller by mandating that any special counsel appointed to investigate a president or his staff could not be fired ""unless you have judicial review of the firing"". He added that Mr Trump was crossing a ""red line"" in his consideration to axe Mr Mueller, who was appointed by the Justice Department to lead the probe after Mr Comey was fired. Mr Graham's warning comes as the president has repeatedly attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia inquiry after failing to disclose a meeting with the Kremlin's envoy during his confirmation hearing. Mr Sessions, known for his hardline anti-immigration stance, was one of then-candidate Mr Trump's earliest supporters in Washington. Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he was ""disappointed"" with Mr Sessions, tweeting that he had ""taken a VERY weak position"" on the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. In an interview with the New York Times, the president expressed regret about appointing Mr Sessions, adding he ""should have never recused himself"". Anthony Scaramucci, the president's new communications director, fuelled the fire on Tuesday by suggesting the attorney general's days could be numbered. Mr Graham on Wednesday said ""there will be holy hell to pay"" if Mr Sessions is fired, warning that there would be ""no confirmation for a new attorney general in 2017"". ""This is not just a diversion, this is unnerving,"" he told reporters. ""It's unfair to Jeff Sessions, he's a good man who deserves better, and some of the suggestions the president is making go way beyond what's acceptable.""",US Senator Lindsey Graham is introducing legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired.,[],[],0
"The performance will be overseen by Chic's Nile Rodgers, who produced Bowie's hit album Let's Dance in 1983. ""The tribute will be a multisensory testament to the icon's incredible artistry and a reflection of his limitless creativity,"" said the Recording Academy in a statement. Gaga has previously credited Bowie as an inspiration. ""He's sort of like an alien prince,"" she once told chat show host Alan Carr. ""Every morning I wake up and I think, 'What would Bowie do?'"" ""We had already booked Lady Gaga on this year's show, but when David passed - almost in a single moment - we knew we had to change direction,"" said Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammys. ""We immediately spoke and agreed that she should be the one to honour David. She's perfect for it."" The Grammys will be held in Los Angeles on 15 February. Gaga is nominated for best song written for visual media, thanks to her Diane Warren-penned ballad Til It Happens To You, from the documentary The Hunting Ground. Other performers on the night include Adele, Kendrick Lamar, James Bay, Ellie Goulding and Carrie Underwood. During his career, Bowie was nominated for 11 Grammys but only won once - when Jazzin' for Blue Jean was awarded best video in 1985. He also received a lifetime achievement prize in 2006. The star died of cancer on 10 January, just days after releasing his new album, Blackstar. It will be eligible for honours at next year's Grammy ceremony.

"Media playback is not supported on this device . Off-spinner JP Duminy took a hat-trick and leg-spinner Imran Tahir 4-26 as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 133. The Proteas then eased to their target for the loss of only one wicket in 18 overs, with Quinton de Kock making an unbeaten 78. They go on to a last-four meeting with New Zealand or West Indies in Auckland on Tuesday. South Africa's first knockout victory in 23 years of playing World Cup cricket takes them to a first semi-final since a famous defeat by Australia in 1999. In reaching their target with 32 overs to spare, AB de Villiers' side also completed the fastest successful run chase in a World Cup knockout match as Sri Lanka, finalists in the previous two World Cups, wilted. Their lacklustre display was not befitting what turned out to be the final international match for Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara's last ODI. The duo have scored 117 international centuries between them. After the Proteas' pace bowlers made early inroads, the spin pair of Duminy and Tahir took advantage of a succession of loose shots, while South Africa were excellent in the field throughout. Sangakkara, on the back of four successive hundreds, made a painstaking 45 and Lahiru Thirimanne a counter-attacking 41, but no other batsman reached 20. To cap South Africa's day, wicketkeeper De Kock, who had managed only 53 runs in his six previous innings, returned to form with a string of cover drives. Still, their victory was built on a brilliant bowling performance after losing the toss on an excellent pitch. New-ball pair Kyle Abbott and Dale Steyn took the edges of Kusal Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan respectively before Sangakkara and Thirimanne steadied with stand of 65. While Thirimanne was fluent through the off side, Sangakkara was stodgy, taking 16 balls to get off the mark and, at one point, having six from 42 balls. When Thirimanne became the first of the seven wickets to fall to spin, Sangakkara was forced to watch from the other end as the middle and lower order fell around him. With the ball holding in the pitch, Thirimanne patted back to Tahir and Jayawardene lobbed the same bowler to short mid-wicket. Duminy, filling the fifth bowler slot which has caused South Africa problems during the tournament, then got to work to become the first Proteas player to take a World Cup hat-trick. Media playback is not supported on this device . Angelo Mathews was caught at mid-on and, in Duminy's next over, Nuwan Kulasekara feathered behind before debutant Tharindu Kaushal was pinned leg before. For 19-year-old Kaushal, it was a golden duck on his ODI debut having being added to the Sri Lanka squad on the morning of the match. Sangakkara was left to play a lone hand, but his attempt at aggression was ended with a slash to third man off Morne Morkel. He departed with 14,234 runs, a tally second only to Sachin Tendulkar, in 404 matches. This was the 150th one-dayer in which he batted with Jayawardene, who has 12,650 runs.

"Events are taking place in Dublin to mark the centenary of the 1916 rebellion against British rule, a seminal moment in Ireland's past. Some unionists have been reluctant to take part in or support the events. Michael D Higgins also said the commemorations are an example to the UK of how to reflect on its own history. The Easter Rising, a brief and militarily unsuccessful republican revolt, is seen by many historians as a significant stepping-stone in the eventual creation of the Republic of Ireland and the partition of the island. A greater depth of knowledge, President Higgins said, meant the Easter Rising was now being put ""in context of what was happening in Europe"" 100 years ago. ""I do think that without 1916, and the events that surrounded it, we would not have achieved our independence,"" he said in a wide-ranging interview for the BBC. ""It is one of the founding events, without a doubt, and it is of immense significance in terms of where it occurs historically but also symbolically."" President Higgins said Ireland's approach to the rising's centenary was one of ""ethical sensitivity"". And he added that ""it is responsible not to be seeing fears where there are none"". ""My great hope, as head of state, is that we will put ourselves into each other's history,"" he said. ""We must be able to take your version, my version, move into the shoes of the other, and we must be open to changing our versions as new facts, information and analysis become available to us. ""I would hope that people in Northern Ireland will approach these commemorations, and as we commemorate the [Battle of the] Somme, that we'd be able to do so generously."" President Higgins said people must not ""become a prisoner of the past"" and ""mustn't allow any distortions of history"". He said everyone's take on history must be open to critique, and that Britain, like Ireland, had to closely examine its past. ""When we decide to address the issue of violence, let us speak of the violence of empire, the violence of state, the violence of insurrection,"" he said. ""Let's do it all - this is the challenge that people are not rising to. ""Having spent decades revising nationalism, where is the evidence that there is as much energy put into addressing the issue of empire? ""As empires came to establishing their stamp on neighbouring countries, what was the consequences of that?"" He described the Northern Ireland peace process as ""fragile"" and an ""ongoing project"", but added it would be ""pessimistic and wrong"" to say significant reconciliation had not been achieved. ""There is real reconciliation going on,"" he said. ""You don't keep picking at the sources of division to undermine what progress you're making in the present in terms of reconciliation."" Earlier this week, the Inniskillings Museum in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, presented President Higgins with a green harp flag that had been taken by a soldier from Dublin's Liberty Hall during the rising.","The Republic of Ireland would not have achieved its independence without the Easter Rising, the country's president has said.",[],[],0
"But the mother-of-four, who received a devastating cancer diagnosis earlier this year, is actively preparing her young family for her death. She is mother to Caileb, 13, Noah, nine, Brooke, eight, and Jesse, 15 months. Mrs Lennox, from Cullybackey, County Antrim, has been thinking of creative ways for her children to feel close to her, long after she is gone. She has made memory boxes for each of them and kept a journal for them to pore over. Mrs Lennox was 34 and pregnant with her youngest child when she was told she had breast cancer. Initial worries centred around the wellbeing of her unborn baby, who was born by emergency C-section at 30 weeks. ""He was a little sleeping beauty after all of my chemotherapy,"" she said. ""He was safe because I had a reduced dose of the treatment, but it was decided that he had to come out early. ""Little Jesse was 3lb when he was born and his lungs were underdeveloped, but he fought to full health. ""I completed my treatment and life returned to pretty much normal."" But after fighting off the disease once, it was to return in January this year. The cancer has now spread to Mrs Lennox's lungs, and her prognosis is not good. ""I am preparing to die,"" she told BBC News NI. ""It may sound morbid and I try not to make things too sad, but I believe it's important that the children know I won't be around forever. ""During my first round of treatment, I explained to them that I was sick and had to take medicine, but when it returned I knew I had to be more honest about the future. ""I've always been the type of mother who wants to protect her kids and to hide them from anything too upsetting. ""But now they know I won't be around to see them grown up and that I'm not going to get better. ""Obviously I was devastated when I got the news - it's not something any mother would want, but life can be taken away from you by cancer at any age. ""I don't have long left, but the kids get to go through some of the sadness they have ahead with me there to comfort them."" As well as the memory boxes and leaving each child advice for the future, Mrs Lennox has been planning her funeral. ""I've sorted the grave, chosen my own coffin, written my eulogy and chosen the readings and hymns,"" she said. ""It's a strange experience, but my husband Alistair, 42, will have the four kids to look after when I'm gone, he doesn't need the stress of organising the funeral too."" Mrs Lennox said she will make her final preparations in the coming days and then put it all to the side in order to spend the time she has left with her family. ""Christmas is my favourite time of year, so although I may not be there this year, we are going to make decorations together to hang around the house,"" she said. Describing her situation now, she said: ""We've been humbled by the support we've received from friends, family and neighbours. ""I am happy, I am comfortable and I am content loving my family and my friends. ""I'm getting on with things as best I can and appreciating every day."" Mrs Lennox has also urged any woman who notices any change in her body to get to the doctor straight away and to check themselves regularly for anything out of the ordinary.","""It may sound morbid and I try not to make things too sad, but I believe it's important that the children know I won't be around forever.""",[],[],0
"The study by Duke Health in the US and published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at 4,274 babies born between 22 and 24 weeks. Compared with those born a decade earlier, a larger percentage were now toddlers without signs of moderate or severe cognitive and motor delay. Changes to care are being credited with the improvement. About 30% of children included in the study who were born between the years 2000 and 2003 survived, but that rate increased to 36% for babies born in 2008 to 2011. The proportion of survivors who did not have a neurological impairment rose from 16% to 20%. The best outcomes were for children born at 23 to 24 weeks. Researcher Prof Noelle Younge called the findings ""encouraging"". ""We see evidence of improvement over time. But we do need to keep an eye on the overall numbers, as a large percentage of infants born at this stage still do not survive. ""Those who survive without significant impairment at about age two are still at risk for numerous other challenges to their overall health."" Full-term babies are born at 37 to 40 weeks. Prof Michael Cotten, one of the other lead researchers, said changes in the culture of neonatal intensive care units were behind the improvement. ""We've taken a big focus on preventing infections, and there's a lot more encouragement and support for the use of mothers' milk than there was 15 years ago, which has also been linked to better outcomes."" There has also been a decrease in infection rates in neonatal intensive care units over the past two decades, which Prof Cotten said was important. The greater use of steroids in mothers at risk of premature birth to help the baby develop in the womb is also thought to have contributed to the increase in survival and fewer signs of developmental delay, he added.","The survival rate of premature babies has improved over the past decade, a study suggests.",[],[],0
"Apple won a ban on the devices, claiming Samsung had copied its iPhone and iPad. South Korean Samsung had been unable to sell products in Australia since July. The two companies are engaged in legal battles in more than 10 countries since April accusing each other of infringing smartphone and tablet patents. Last month, Samsung won an appeal against a temporary ban on sales. However, Apple was awarded a stay of the orders. On Friday Apple's bid to extend the ban was turned down by the High Court. The ruling is a rare win for Samsung as it allows the company to sell its Galaxy Tab 10.1 in time for the busy Christmas shopping season, a lucrative time for the industry. The decision comes after a US court ruled against Apple's bid to ban Galaxy phones and tablets, another win for Samsung. Apple has appealed against that ruling. However, the legal tussle in other markets is not going as well for Samsung.

"A poll carried out on behalf of the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) suggested 68% of Londoners were behind the measure. Boris Johnson said there was ""broad support"". However more than 37,000 people have signed an online petition against the purchase. The cannon will be purchased if Home Secretary Theresa May licences them. The Metropolitan Police and Mayor of London Mr Johnson want to buy three cannon from Germany for Â£90,000. They have been linked to causing broken bones and blindness. Mr Johnson said: ""No-one wants to see water cannon routinely deployed on the streets of London but having carefully weighed up all the evidence, I have concluded there is broad support amongst Londoners for the use of this measure by the police in limited circumstances. ""However, it is critical that Londoners are assured that there are robust safeguards in place before seeing water cannon in action."" The mayor said he would now write to the Home Secretary to support the request for water cannon. The independent poll conducted by TNS questioned 4,223 people and found 52% said they would have greater confidence in the Met Police's ability to respond to serious public disorder if water cannon were available. In addition the mayor carried out a six-week consultation in January and February to gather the views of Londoners on the use of water cannon. There were 2,606 consultation responses received via email and 4,048 email petition responses. From the email consultation 59 people supported the introduction of water cannon. Concerns were raised by more than 2,500 email respondents and more than 4,000 people responded to the ""Boris: stop the water cannon"" and the ""No to water cannon"" email petitions. Respondents also mentioned a change.org petition with more than 37,000 signatures against the proposals. London Assembly member Jenny Jones, of the Green Party, said: ""He has ignored the members of the public who responded to the consultation, and the views of the Assembly including members of his own party and team, to push ahead with his plans for this weapon."" Water cannon have been used in Northern Ireland but they are not currently authorised in Britain. The Home Secretary must approve their introduction in England and Wales. An ethics panel, headed by barrister Lord Carlile, will be put in place to look at when water cannon should be used, if they are licensed by the home secretary. She has refused to provide central government funding for the machines in London.

The project's lead scientists told China's state news agency that the telescope would further the search for intelligent life in the universe. It will dwarf the world's current largest such telescope in Puerto Rico. The 500m-wide Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) is due to be operational this year. Provincial officials have vowed to relocate 9,110 residents living within five kilometres of the listening device by September, the official Xinhua news agency said. The relocations will ""create a sound electromagnetic wave environment"", the news agency cited regional official Li Yuecheng as saying. Residents will reportedly receive 12,000 yuan (Â£1,280; $1,800) in subsidies for their troubles, with some getting extra support for housing, it said. FAST, built at a cost of 1.2bn yuan, will dwarf the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico as the world's largest radio telescope, which is about 300m in diameter.

The DUP's Junior Minister, Alastair Ross, is also attending. However, Sinn Féin has accused the government of treating the council as a ""talking shop"". Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit means leaving the European Customs Union. It currently allows tariff and paperwork-free trade between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Féin MLA John O'Dowd said on Thursday: ""By making her so-called keynote speech on Brexit... this week two days ahead of the Joint Ministerial Council, British Prime Minister Theresa May treated the council with utter disdain."" He added: ""That was a clear act of bad faith... it is clear she is intent on ignoring the will of the majority of people in the north who voted to remain in the EU. ""It has got to the stage where the Joint Ministerial Council is being treated as a talking shop by the British government and we will be reassessing our involvement with it."" The DUP see the council as a useful forum to air their concerns. The DUP and Sinn Féin were joined at the council meeting by ministers from Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland Office minister Lord Dunlop described the talks as ""a constructive session in looking at the devolved administrations' important contribution to the process of planning the UK's departure from the European Union"". ""In her speech this week, the prime minister emphasised the importance of working together to achieve a deal that works for Northern Ireland as part of a United Kingdom that is determined to take advantage of the opportunities that leaving the EU presents,"" he said. Earlier, Mr Hazzard said Northern Ireland needed a ""special designated status"" within the EU. Former Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) John Bruton has said Mrs May's plan for a post-Brexit customs deal will be ""unworkable"".

Brexit Secretary David Davis has said the UK leaving the EU would result in difficulties over border controls on the island of Ireland, but that any problems could be solved. What is a customs union and why does it matter? A customs union is a form of trade agreement between two or more countries. It means they decide not to impose tariffs (taxes on imports) on each other's goods and agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from countries outside their customs union. Setting common external tariffs is what distinguishes a customs union from a free trade area. The key argument for leaving the customs union is that it will allow the UK to negotiate its own trade agreements.

"So far most of the ground troops deployed are there to protect the airbase, but satellite evidence suggests that at least two other Syrian bases are being prepared to receive additional Russian troops. The Russian build-up is being closely monitored - not least by the Israelis, who have been flying intelligence-gathering aircraft off the coast between Cyprus and Lebanon on a regular circuit. Most of the information available to the media comes from images from civil satellites, but of course US military satellites will also be watching developments, seeking any detail that might give a hint of Russian intentions. Imagery analysts will be looking for evidence of weapons stores; of munitions being loaded on to aircraft or for any other signs of jets being prepared for operational sorties. The electromagnetic spectrum will also be monitored from Western bases in Cyprus and from Israel, where the military has no shortage of Russian speakers. Reports suggest that some of the Russian aircraft have already been undertaking familiarisation flights in Syrian airspace. But the question remains - what will Moscow do next? Is this all preliminary to a direct Russian intervention in the fighting? Or is this something else - military theatre on a grand scale to achieve wider diplomatic objectives? What President Vladimir Putin appears to be doing in Syria is to use at least the threat of military force to pursue his wider diplomatic goals. To see what is going on, one must pull back from the close-up images of Russian warplanes on the tarmac and look at the wider diplomatic picture. Russia - isolated and confronting Western sanctions due to its behaviour in Ukraine - is genuinely concerned about the rise of Islamist fundamentalism, which threatens to spread ever closer to Russia's own borders. It wants to see the so-called Islamic State defeated and some order restored in Syria, where it has long maintained a strategic interest. It believes Western policy in the region has been self-serving and wildly naive. Existing regimes have been toppled leaving little more than chaos in their wake. With the UN General Assembly in New York fast approaching, Mr Putin is eager to embark upon a new initiative on the world stage; one that will highlight Russia's distinctive voice, but one that also will underline what he sees as Moscow's irreplaceable role in the international system. So seen in this light, the Russian deployment to Syria may already have achieved much of what Mr Putin is seeking. For a start Russia has demonstrated that it is a strategic player in the region and is prepared to put its military might behind its diplomacy. It has also demonstrated that its support for President Bashar al-Assad, at least for the short- and medium-term, is solid and a factor with which all other actors must contend. On the purely diplomatic front, the US has reopened military talks with Moscow. Mr Putin is due to meet President Barack Obama shortly - an encounter that will have been highly unlikely if Ukraine alone was top of their agenda. Even more significantly, key actors like the Americans and some of their Nato allies, have altered their rhetoric. They are now careful to speak about Mr Assad having no ""long-term"" role in Syria - leaving open what might happen in the short- and medium-term. There are certainly risks in Mr Putin's military gamble in Syria. But there are clearly opportunities for Russia too. And that is what Mr Putin is counting upon.",Russia's military build-up in Syria is being closely watched.,[],[],0
"Some 853,000 16- to 24-year-olds were NEET at the end of 2015, down 110,000 on the same quarter of 2014. But the figures also show the numbers were 5,000 higher than in the summer. City and Guilds managing director Kirstie Donnelly said it was ""worrying"" to see the figures ""creep up after months of more positive news"". The Office of National Statistics figures date back to October to December 2001 when 833,000 young people were classified as NEET, some 12.9% of the total age-group. At the end of last year that proportion had fallen to 11.8%. NEET numbers reached from highs of over a million, or more than 16% of the age-group, in 2011, but have fallen consistently since. In England, the government raised the education participation age to 17 in September 2013 and to 18 in September 2015. So young people in England are now expected to stay in full-time education, in an apprenticeship, or in employment with training until they are 18. The UK-wide NEET figures first dropped below the million mark, to 987,000, or 13.5% of the age group in the first quarter of 2014. England-only figures show there were 690,000 NEETs at the end of last year, almost 100,000 fewer than in the last quarter of 2014. This figure is the lowest since 2000 when comparable records began and the number stood at 629,000, says the government. Skills Minister Nick Boles said the figures showed the government was delivering on its commitment to ensure all young people were either earning or learning. ""There is no room for complacency, though, and through our plans to deliver three million new apprenticeships by 2020 and our qualification reforms, we are determined to build on these excellent results,"" said Mr Boles. But campaigners say the figures are still too high . ""More than one in every 10 teenagers is currently locked out of a path to the future,"" said Ms Donnelly. And Jenny North, policy and strategy director of Impetus PEF, which funds projects to help the most disadvantaged young people, called for more government action. ""We need to see a clear focus from government on how they will help disadvantaged young people succeed in education, and progress into sustained employment so they can fulfil their potential,"" said Ms North.","The number of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) in the UK has fallen below the million mark for the first time, official figures show.","['The summary states that the NEET figure has fallen below the million mark for the first time, but the text states this occurred in the first quarter of 2014, not for the first time now.']",[],0
"In his closing speech, prosecutor Philip Evans told Woolwich Crown Court the men had given ""lies"" and ""half truths"" as evidence during the trial. Carl Wood, William Lincoln, Jon Harbinson and Hugh Doyle all deny being part in the Â£14m theft. Four other men have already pleaded guilty to taking part in the raid. Summing up the case against the accused men, Mr Evans said the robbery had involved a ""staggering sum of money"" and had been a carefully planned operation by men who knew what they were doing. He asked the jury to consider whether the ""ringleaders"" - who had already pleaded guilty - would have trusted those on trial to look after their jewel-laden bags and not take a ""peek"" inside. ""The men who have pleaded guilty were a group who thrived on acquisitive crime - taking people's money and possessions, greed in reality. ""What they needed were people who wouldn't question that,"" he said. Referring to Mr Lincoln's claim that he did not know what was in the bags he helped move, he asked the jury whether they could ""believe that for one second?"" ""They were never going to let that significant commodity go into the hands of someone they did not trust,"" he said. Mr Evans insisted the four men had not told the truth to the court. ""On each of the four occasions that you have heard the defendants give evidence, each of them have told you lies,"" Mr Evans said. He added that it did not matter what size role each of the men had played because ""if you take part knowingly, you're guilty"". The case continues. Daniel Jones, 60, of Park Avenue, Enfield; John Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington; Terry Perkins, 67, of Heene Road, Enfield, and Brian Reader, 76, of Dartford Road, Dartford, have all previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary.",Jurors in the trial of four men accused of the Hatton Garden jewellery raid have been told they must convict them if they believe their evidence.,"['The summary states that jurors have been told they must convict the men if they believe their evidence, but the text does not state this.

"It is claimed the accounts for the Cleddau Bridge are confusing, with some showing a loss and others a profit. Motorists pay 75p - lorry drivers £1.50 - to cross between Pembroke Dock and Neyland. There have been previous calls to scrap the tolls altogether. The council said it will review both the physical and financial management of the bridge. The announcement follows a complaint from a member of the public to the Wales Audit Office, which argued that money collected by the council was not being spent in line with rules governing the bridge. The complaint also suggested that council accounts for the bridge are confusing. One set of Pembrokeshire council figures for 2013/14 show the bridge operation made a loss of £60.6m. A second set of figures for the same period suggest the loss was £9.3m. And a third set of figures state that the council actually made a combined surplus of £17.6m. Council officials have confirmed to BBC Wales that £60m deficit is in fact a 'notional' loss - and does not actually exist. The second part of the complaint to auditors is over whether the council should be allowed to make a profit - and where that money should be spent. Collecting tolls on the Cleddau Bridge is governed by legislation set out by the UK Parliament in the Dyfed Act 1987. Council leader Jamie Adams said the authority's position was that it can make a profit as long as the funds are used for other transport projects. However, he accepted that the wording of the 1987 law was unclear. Mr Adams added: ""We've simply followed the example set by our predecessor authority Dyfed. ""Certainly there are different ways to interpret the act which allow for different accounting practices to be undertaken.""

"It is estimated the new law could raise up to Â£1m a year for the Welsh NHS. The bill's sponsor, Labour AM Mick Antoniw, said it would help people whose lives had been blighted by ""this terrible disease"". The insurance industry has raised concerns, questioning whether the move is within the assembly's powers. Before becoming an assembly member, Mr Antoniw was a solicitor at the legal firm which has acted for many asbestos victims and their families. Speaking before the bill was passed, he said: ""It is only right that medical costs incurred by the NHS should be recovered from those who caused the disease and used to give more support to asbestos victims and their families - for example, a cancer nurse costs Â£50,000 per annum.

"The most extreme arctic blasts, blamed on a weather pattern known as the polar vortex, were said to have affected nearly 190 million people. In Kentucky, an escaped prisoner turned himself in to get out of the cold. Some parts of the Midwest hit -26C (-14F), as low as the Antarctic coast in winter, and much colder than the inside of a domestic freezer. Temperature records were shattered in states across the US, including Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Michigan, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. It was -17C (1F) in the small town of Hell, Michigan, prompting online jokes that the weather was so bad even hell had frozen over. But it was Embarrass, Minnesota, that experienced the lowest temperature in the nation on Tuesday: -37C (-35F). That was colder than readings recently recorded on the Red Planet by the Mars Rover. A video of a meteorologist tossing a pot of boiling water into the air in Wisconsin, to demonstrate how it immediately turns to snow, quickly went viral on the internet and was widely imitated. A woman in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was taken to hospital with severe burns after she slipped on ice while attempting the trick, spilling boiling water on herself, the Argus Leader newspaper reported. The extreme weather resulted in the usual travel chaos - nearly 2,700 US flights were cancelled on Tuesday. More than 500 rail passengers on their way to Chicago were marooned overnight into Tuesday morning in northern Illinois on three Amtrak passenger trains after drifting snow and ice covered the tracks. The big freeze was even testing the resolve of Canadians, no strangers to cold weather.

"A classified advert in the free newspaper, the UK China Times, available throughout the UK, was used to recruit the women. It is followed by a UK mobile number that leads to a brothel in Belfast.

Posing as a potential recruit, she called the number in the advert and spoke in Mandarin to Lisa. After asking her age, and if she was fat, Lisa agreed to employ the journalist for sex work.

"About 10 ""non-sponsored sleepovers"" have been logged across the world by the Swedish furniture giant this year. In the past, people have hidden themselves in stores in the US, Canada, UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Japan, Australia and Poland. Most recently, two 14-year-old girls were caught after spending the night at the branch in Jonkoping in Sweden. The craze appears to have been started by two Belgian YouTubers in August. Their video, which has had 1.7 million views, documents their exploits - including jumping on beds - after they hid in a wardrobe for three hours to avoid detection. Unlike the 14-year-old girls, however, they were not caught and walked out after spending another few hours in the wardrobes waiting for the store to open.

"Rising energy prices pushed inflation to 1.8% in January, a near four-year high and up from 1.1% in December. Eurostat data also showed the jobless rate fell to 9.6% in December, the lowest rate since May 2009. GDP growth edged up to 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. The rise in eurozone inflation last month was driven by an 8.1% jump in energy prices in January compared with the year before. The spike in the rate takes it up to the European Central Bank's inflation target of close to, but below, 2%. Some have called for the European Central Bank to further scale back its bond-buying programme. However, the ECB also looks at core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food prices, in its policy decisions, and this rate remained unchanged at 0.9% in January. In December, the ECB said it would buy bonds worth 60bn euros a month from April. The 80bn euro-a-month quantitative easing scheme had been due to end in March, but was expected to be extended. The stimulus programme was an effort to increase the supply of money in the economic bloc to keep interest rates low, and encourage borrowing and spending. The European Central Bank's key job is to maintain ""price stability"" in the Eurozone, which it interprets as inflation of below but close to 2%. For the last few years it has been wrestling with inflation that its governing council considers too low, at times even below zero - a situation of deflation or falling prices. That has led the bank to choose very unusual policies intended to stimulate prices rises - ultra-low interest rates (one of its rates is negative) and quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly created money. So with inflation now at 1.8%, pretty much in line with the target, is that job done? Time to turn the policy taps off? Not necessarily. The rise in inflation is down to higher food and especially energy prices. The impact of those factors is likely to fade and other price rises are still relatively slow. There are different views in the ECB's governing council but the majority are not likely to be in a hurry to get policy back to normal. The eurozone's unemployment rate of 9.6% in December was down from 9.7% in November and compares with a rate of 10.5% a year earlier. The countries with the lowest unemployment rates in December were the Czech Republic (3.5%) and Germany (3.9%), while countries with the highest levels of unemployment were Greece (23.0% in October 2016) and Spain (18.4%). Despite the pick-up in economic growth during the final quarter of 2016, across the year as a whole eurozone GDP rose by 1.7%, which was down from 2% in 2015. Analysts also questioned whether the recent improvement could be sustained. ""While recent economic news points to improved growth, we suspect the eurozone may find it difficult to sustain this momentum amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. ""Consequently, we suspect that eurozone GDP growth in 2017 will be no more than 1.6%. We also see growth at 1.6% in 2018.""","Inflation in the eurozone has risen to a four-year high, according to official figures.","['The summary states that inflation has risen to a four-year high, but the text specifies it is a ""near four-year high,"" not definitively a four-year high.']",[],0
"Phil Gormley said he would be ""foolish"" to rule out more armed police following the Paris terror attacks . He suggested armed police on routine duties may be appropriate in certain circumstances. The current UK threat level for international terrorism is ""severe"" meaning an attack is highly likely. Mr Gormley's predecessor, Sir Stephen House, withdrew armed police from routine patrols following a public outcry about police with guns attending minor incidents. In a briefing at Police Scotland's Tulliallan headquarters on his second day in the job, the chief constable said Police Scotland ""needs to have a very careful look"" at armed policing. ""There are lessons to be learned post-Paris around tactics, techniques, the numbers of officers that we have got and their deployment,"" he said. ""So that is a question that constantly needs to be revisited as the threat level around serious and organised crime alters and the threat level around CT (counter-terrorism) alters.""

""If the threat from CT and serious organised crime demands that we increase our armed capacity to protect the people of Scotland, then I will need to do that.""

He added: ""If the threat level is sufficiently high that we need armed officers to protect the public, then that is what we will need to provide."" Mr Gormley said he respected the Scottish government's decision to maintain its commitment to having 1,000 more police officers than the SNP inherited when it came to power. But he warned choices would have to be made to protect citizens that involve new techniques and technology as well as police officer numbers and the right mix of resources. He said Police Scotland ""do need to think about what capabilities we need for the future"" in relation to police officer numbers. ""Some of that will absolutely be about people, and some of it will be about skills, technical kit and investment,"" he said. ""Choices will have to be made. I don't want to get into a specific conversation about numbers, but I do think in the next five to 10 years the sorts of demands that police all over the UK will face will require both people and investments and new techniques and technology.""

The largest deal is the with OLAM, a Singapore-based company which plans to develop a huge palm oil plantation in the south east. The government wants to become the leading palm oil producer in Africa. In terms of infrastructure, the OLAM deal involves the construction of a refinery, and there are plans for a possible port. Another agreement was signed with the Indian company M3M, to build 5,000 low-cost housing units over the next two years. Ramky Infrastructure, another Indian construction company, will build 1,000 kilometres of tarred road over the next three years in a $1.5bn project that will be jointly financed by the Gabonese government.

"A Freedom of Information request revealed there were 634 reports in the 2015-16 financial year, compared with 316 the year before. Police said the rise could have been caused by changes over which incidents schools can deal with internally. An education expert called the figures ""worrying"" and said police needed to identify the reason for the increases. John Howson, who is also a former teacher, said: ""I'm extremely worried about these figures - the doubling of the violence against a person, whatever source it is or however minor."" Thames Valley Police said more incidents were now included in their figures after the Home Office clarified a policy about what must be investigated. It added: ""Recorded violent crime went up in the Thames Valley overall last year by 30% so we would anticipate an increase in violence in schools as well. ""All schools in Thames Valley have contact with police through either dedicated schools officers or neighbourhood policing teams. ""Their approach is one of preventing young people from entering the criminal justice system rather than criminalising them.""

"Police in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state, fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones and burning tyres in the streets, witnesses said. Several protesters chanted slogans calling for the government's downfall. Since June, Sudan has seen sporadic protests against government austerity measures, including fuel subsidy cuts. The country's authorities have been trying to cut spending since Sudan lost three-quarters of its oil revenue when South Sudan seceded last year. Demonstrators in Nyala chanted ""No to high prices"" and ""People want to change the regime"", according to witnesses. Bothina Mohmed Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the state of South Darfur, said it was not known how the six deaths had happened, and that an investigation had been launched. Opposition activists and media accused the police of using live ammunition. The protests started on Monday when local students ""rejected the price of transport announced by the government"", Ms Ahmed said, adding that ""other groups"" had joined the protests and attacked government buildings. ""This has been happening on the main roads and in the main market area. There's been some damage to buildings,"" African Union-UN peacekeeping mission spokesman Christopher Cycmanick told AFP. The anti-austerity protests in Sudan began in June among students in Khartoum, but have since spread to other social groups and areas. They had recently dwindled as a result of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began on 20 July. Until this year, Sudan had escaped the unrest characteristic of recent uprisings in Arab countries such as neighbouring Egypt, but correspondents say economic hardship caused by austerity has led to growing dissatisfaction with President Omar al-Bashir.","At least six people have been killed during anti-austerity protests in western Sudan, officials say.","['The summary states the protests occurred in western Sudan, but the text specifies that the protests occurred in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state, without explicitly stating it is in western Sudan.

"The deal, to hand over the Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir, was agreed during a visit to Egypt by Saudi King Salman in April 2016. It sparked rare protests in Egypt, with the president accused of ""selling"" the islands in return for Saudi aid. The deal has been subject to challenges in court over the past year. But parliament has insisted the issue lies in its jurisdiction. Final approval is now needed from President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. Protesters gathered outside the press union in Cairo as news of parliament's approval became known. Several people, including some journalists, were detained. Mr Sisi said the islands had always belonged to Saudi Arabia and that the Saudis had asked Egypt to station troops there in 1950 to protect them. A court ruled in January that the government had failed to provide evidence that the islands were originally Saudi, although this ruling was overturned by another court a few months later. Opponents accuse Mr Sisi of violating the constitution and handing over the islands to please Saudi Arabia which has backed him financially since he led the military's overthrow of his elected Islamist predecessor, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013.",Egypt's parliament has approved a controversial deal to hand over two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia.,[],[],0

"In 1903, scientists decided Brontosaurus was a more complete specimen of a different dinosaur. But many more specimens of plant-eating sauropod dinosaurs are now known, revealing Brontosaurus to be different enough to warrant its own name. The results have been published in the open access journal PeerJ. The name Brontosaurus goes back to the so-called Bone Wars of the late 1800s, when rival fossil hunters Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope raced new dinosaur names into the scientific literature. In their quest for new specimens, Marsh and Cope were drawn to the rich fossil beds of the American west. Marsh's team found two long-necked sauropods. He named one Apatosaurus ajax (Apatosaurus means ""deceptive lizard"") and the second skeleton Brontosaurus excelsus (Brontosaurus means ""noble thunder lizard""). Shortly after Marsh's death, a team from the Field Museum of Chicago found another dinosaur skeleton similar to both Apatosaurus ajax and Brontosaurus excelsus, but with features deemed intermediate between the two. This led the scientists to conclude that Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were just different species within the same scientific genus. Apatosaurus took precedence because it had been named first so, Brontosaurus excelsus became Apatosaurus excelsus. But the name Brontosaurus is still known by several generations of schoolchildren. It's not entirely clear why the name stuck, but it may be to do with its origins in the Bone Wars, when there was intense public interest in the discovery of new dinosaurs. It may also be because of the evocative meaning: ""thunder lizard"". Now, Emanuel Tschopp from the New University of Lisbon in Portugal and colleagues applied statistical techniques to calculate the differences between species and genera of diplodocid dinosaurs (the large-scale grouping that includes Apatosaurus as well as other long-necked plant eaters). It is only with new finds of dinosaurs similar to Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus in recent years that it became possible to undertake a detailed investigation of how different they were. ""Until very recently, the claim that Brontosaurus was the same as Apatosaurus was completely reasonable, based on the knowledge we had,"" said Mr Tschopp. To their suprise, Brontosaurus emerged from the analysis as a distinct dinosaur. ""The differences we found between Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus were at least as numerous as the ones between other closely related genera, and much more than what you normally find between species,"" explained Roger Benson, a co-author from the University of Oxford. Thus, the researchers argue that it is now possible to resurrect Brontosaurus as a genus, different from Apatosaurus. Prof Paul Barrett, of London's Natural History Museum, who was not involved in the research, told BBC News: ""This paper is the most comprehensive study produced to date on the evolution of Diplodocus and its closest relatives and sets out some really interesting new ideas on how these animals are related, and how they should be classified. ""The author finds a number of ways in which the original specimens of Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus can be separated from each other and uses these to resurrect Brontosaurus as a separate entity. ""The conclusions seem entirely reasonable to me, as they are well argued and well supported, and it will be interesting to see how how quickly these suggestions are adopted by the community."" Marsh's case was not helped by making an incorrect reconstruction of Brontosaurus' skull because of the limited material available at the time. He had assumed it was boxy, like another long-necked dinosaur from the western US known as Camarasaurus. But research in the 1970s showed that Apatosaurus - and thus ""Brontosaurus"" - would have had a slender, horse-like skull. This gave rise to a popular myth that ""Brontosaurus"" was simply an Apatosaurus with the wrong head.

"But US President Donald Trump appears to be laying claim to the phrase for himself. In an interview with The Economist published on Thursday, he used the metaphor to describe his hopes for tax reform. Then he asked: ""Have you heard that expression used before? Because I haven't heard it. I mean, I justâ€¦ I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It's what you have to do."" His claim immediately raised eyebrows. Or, as The New York Observer put it: ""The Entire Internet Is Trolling President Trump Over 'Priming the Pump."" Far from being a Trump-coined neologism, priming the pump has a long history in economic theory and was in widespread use by the 1930s. It's most often associated with John Maynard Keynes, the influential British economist who urged public spending to stimulate a weak economy. Newspapers also made the comparison during the presidency of Herbert Hoover, who was in office during the Wall Street Crash. Early Thursday morning, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary Twitter account struck back, noting: ""'Pump priming' has been used to refer to government investment expenditures since at least 1933."" The Oxford English Dictionary identifies the phrase used in a business context even earlier, quoting a 1916 edition of Everybody's Mag: ""When the waters of business are stagnant, gentlemen, it becomes necessary, if I may say so, to prime the pump."" The White House press office did not respond to an email seeking clarification on Mr Trump's comments. But even Mr Trump has a longer history with the expression.

"Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced that Tiran and Sanafir would be transferred in April, during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman. More than 150 people were jailed in connection with protests over the deal, though many were later acquitted or had their sentences reduced on appeal. The Egyptian government has said it will challenge Tuesday's ruling. Tiran and Sanafir are uninhabited and located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, a strategic part of the Red Sea bordered by Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Egyptian troops have been stationed there since 1950 at Riyadh's request. Mr Sisi's decision in April to cede control of them to Saudi Arabia sparked widespread criticism. The president was accused of violating the constitution and ""selling"" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package unveiled by King Salman during his visit. But Mr Sisi insisted that Tiran and Sanafir had always belonged to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Egypt's State Council, an administrative court, issued a verdict annulling April's maritime borders agreement between Cairo and Riyadh. The maritime border agreement signed earlier this year between Egypt and Saudi Arabia took many Egyptians by surprise. Since then, protesters have taken to the streets calling the arrangement unconstitutional, and accusing the government of giving away Egyptian territories in return for aid packages and investments worth billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, a strong backer of President Sisi. Some of these protesters were arrested and charged with disrupting public order. A few are still behind bars. The lawsuit was filed by a number of prominent human rights lawyers, headed by a former presidential candidate, Khaled Ali. When the verdict was issued, many cheered inside the courtroom, chanting ""the islands are Egyptian"". But the legal battle has not come to an end yet, because the decision can be appealed. The verdict stated that the two islands would ""remain under Egyptian sovereignty"". If it is approved by the country's High Administrative Court it will become legally binding. However, the State Lawsuits Authority, which represents the Egyptian state in lawsuits, said on Tuesday evening that it would challenge the ruling, state television reported. Mr Sisi has cracked down on all dissent since leading the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. Since then, more than 1,000 people have been killed and 40,000 are believed to have been jailed, most of them supporters of Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood.",A court in Egypt has annulled an agreement with Saudi Arabia to hand over two Red Sea islands to Riyadh.,[],[],0
"Lee Johnson, 45, had been a voluntary patient with depression at Maelor Hospital when he hanged himself in February 2016. The witnesses were asked to spell out changes in their working practices following his death. A narrative verdict was recorded and the health board said it fully accepted the coroner's findings. Sgt Johnson, of Pantymwyn, near Mold, served with the West Mercia force and was based in Oswestry. The two day inquest in Ruthin previously heard he had been under investigation for alleged misconduct by the police watchdog, although coroner John Gittins said it was ""not of any great consequence"". He had told his wife Barbara Johnson that he felt safe in the Heddfan unit and was described as a ""model patient"" and eager to engage with anything that would help him get better. But he spoke of suicide when under the influence of alcohol. Sgt Johnson was known to have taken alcohol on two occasions while in the unit, and was suspected of drinking on several other occasions. Mr Gittins said the unit had ""entirely failed to address the risk"" Sgt Johnson posed to himself, especially after consuming alcohol, and that the policy on patients taking alcohol needed to be far more robust. ""As an outsider it is hard to understand how a person can be intoxicated in Heddfan,"" he said. Earlier, Dr Stuart Porter, interim clinical director with Betsi Cadwaladr health board, outlined improvements introduced in an action plan, including more one-to-one sessions, better documentation and liaison with family members. Asked whether the risk to Sgt Johnson had been underestimated in the light of previous incidents when he had been drinking, Dr Porter said: ""Potentially yes, but predicting a risk is difficult."" Recording his narrative conclusion, Mr Gittins said he felt existing policies were good and would work in practice. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Johnson, herself a police officer with North Wales Police, said her husband had been desperate to get help. She said she was encouraged by the health board's review but said she felt ""they have not recognised the failings in his care that I believe contributed to his death"". ""I appreciated the coroner seeking reassurance from those staff that the lessons have, in fact, been learned,"" she said.

"Called My Brother's Keeper, his new initiative aims to overcome the socioeconomic conditions keeping such youth from thriving. The White House said businesses had pledged $150m (Â£89m) to promote it. The president said it was an ""outrage"" that black and Hispanic men in the US fared so much worse than white men. ""I believe the continuing struggles of so many boys and young men - the fact that too many of them are falling by the wayside, dropping out, unemployed, involved in negative behaviour, going to jail, being profiled - this is a moral issue for our country,"" Mr Obama said at the White House on Thursday, with more than a dozen black and Hispanic young men and boys standing behind him. ""It's also an economic issue for our country."" In a memorandum released on Thursday, the White House said the task force would focus on issues facing boys and young minority men under the age of 25. America's first black president has generally avoided policies defined by race, the BBC's Beth McLeod reports from Washington DC, but in an emotional speech Mr Obama said it was an outrage that young Hispanic and African-American men have the odds stacked against them in US society. President Obama said young men from this group were more likely to have no father in the house, end up behind bars, or become victims of violent crime. The White House has cited the relatively high unemployment rate for black and Hispanic men over the age of 20 and a higher-than-national-average poverty rate for minority households. ""We've become numb to these statistics, we're not surprised by them, we take them as the norm,"" Mr Obama said. ""We just assume this is an inevitable part of American life, instead of the outrage that it is. ""But these statistics should break our hearts. And they should compel us to act."" He spoke of visiting a school near his home in Chicago and sharing with the boys there his own experience of growing up without a father, acknowledging to them that he had been angry about that and had made ""bad choices"" and ""got high without always thinking about the harm that it could do"". ""I could see myself in these young men,"" Mr Obama told the audience at the White House. ""And the only difference is that I grew up in an environment that was a little bit more forgiving, so when I made a mistake the consequences were not as severe."" Mr Obama's new initiative calls for foundations and community groups to co-ordinate investment in support programmes to keep young Hispanic and black men in school and away from crime. A public online portal called What Works will provide access to data about such programmes. To start the programme, a new federal task force will look at several issues affecting young men. These include access to childhood support, grade school literacy, pathways to university and careers, as well as interactions with the criminal justice system and violent crime. President Obama earlier met with foundation and business leaders and senior government officials to discuss the initiative and to thank them for their support. According to the White House, business leaders have already invested $150m and plan to invest another $200m in the project over the next five years. Senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett described the effort earlier on Thursday as the beginning of a life-long endeavour for Mr Obama and his wife Michelle.

Princess Charlotte was born on Saturday in London's St Mary's Hospital, weighing 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg). The Queen met her new great-granddaughter at Kensington Palace for the first time on Tuesday. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said a cot blanket made from Tasmanian merino wool was being sent on behalf of the Australian people to mark the royal birth. It was made at the country's oldest weaving mill, Waverly Woollen Mills, Tasmania, and has been embroidered with the Australian floral emblem, the wattle. Mr Abbott said his government would also be making a A$10,000 (Â£5,200) donation to the Healesville Sanctuary, in Victoria, in honour of the princess.

"Government figures show 375 doses, sent to addresses in England, Wales, and Scotland, were seized in 2016, compared with just five in 2013. Taking the pills while pregnant without medical approval is illegal in the UK. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said as awareness of the online pills increased, more women were using them. The figures, from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - which regulates medicines in the UK - show there were 375 pills seized last year, up from 270 in 2015 and 180 in 2014. The seizures were made during the MHRA's annual week-long raids, known as Operation Pangea, at places like postal hubs where foreign post is kept before being distributed to local post offices. NHS abortion treatment is free and widely available in Britain, but remains mostly illegal in Northern Ireland. However, the UK currently has the harshest punishment for self-induced abortion of any country in Europe, bar the Republic of Ireland.

Two women have been jailed for using the abortion pill bought online in the UK. In 2012, 40-year-old Sarah Catt was jailed for eight years for terminating her pregnancy with pills she had bought online when she was 39 weeks pregnant.

Ann Furedi, Bpas chief executive, said women who bought the pills were often ""desperate"" and in ""difficult circumstances"". ""At Bpas, we do all that we can to make abortion services as accessible as possible. However, it is clear that for some women the barriers to clinic-based treatment feel insurmountable,"" she said. ""They are not criminals deserving of life imprisonment. Evidence suggests that as awareness of online abortion pills is increasing, so too are the numbers of women using these methods."" She said women should not face criminal punishment. ""Fifty years after the 1967 Act was passed, it is time to bring women's reproductive healthcare into the 21st Century and remove abortion from the criminal law,"" she added.

"The line-up includes Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter and is best viewed from southern parts of the northern hemisphere. In Northern Ireland, astronomers say all five planets should come into view simultaneously by about 24 January. The Irish Astronomical Association said it will be a ""sight not to be missed"". However, successful planet spotting will depend on local weather conditions and the amount of cloud in the sky. Terry Moseley, a former president of the Irish Astronomical Association, said Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter are the only five planets that are ever visible from Earth with the naked eye, but it is rare to see all of them at once. He said that in the UK, the alignment would be visible in southern parts of England first and should come into view in Northern Ireland a few days later, as it lies further north. Mr Moseley added that four of the planets can be seen from Northern Ireland at the moment on clear nights, but added that ""elusive little Mercury"" is always the hardest to see because it is closest to the horizon. ""Mercury will be easiest to see from about 28 January to 2 February, but you should start looking from about 24 January in case the skies are cloudy later,"" Mr Moseley advised skywatchers. ""You should start looking from about 45 minutes before sunrise, and you'll need a good clear horizon to the south east,"" he added. ""Venus will be by far the brightest, a brilliant beacon above the south east horizon. Look about a hand-span to the left of Venus, and slightly below it, to try to spot Mercury, which will be much fainter, and not easy to find in the twilight glow."" The director of Armagh Observatory, Mark Bailey, said the last time such a view was visible was January 2005. He will be talking to schoolchildren in Tandragee library, County Armagh, on Thursday, explaining what to look out for.

The pre-dawn sky show is best viewed from high ground, in places were there is little light pollution. ""You need a good, dark view towards the southern horizon,"" Mr Bailey said. He suggested locations such as Divis mountain in Belfast; the Sperrins in counties Londonderry and Tyrone and Slieve Beagh near the border with County Monaghan. The alignment will be visible from some areas until 20 February, but both local astronomers advised that the window will be much shorter in Northern Ireland as Mercury will disappear from view several days earlier.",Skywatchers in Northern Ireland are being urged to catch a glimpse of a rare alignment of five planets in the night sky.,[],[],0
"It cost Charles Clarke his job as home secretary when back in 2006 it emerged that more than 1,000 foreign prisoners who should have been deported hadn't been. It's also been the subject of several select committee inquiries. And it continues to vex the Conservative MP for Kettering, Philip Hollobone. Throughout his time as an MP he has raised concerns about the number of foreigners in our prisons and our failure to send them back home to serve their sentences. Now a government minister not only praised him for his campaign, but admitted that he too shares Mr Hollobone's frustration. Mike Penning, minister for policing and criminal justice, told Parliament that while being briefed by officials he was ""very surprised... about some of the things that are being done"" and found it ""mind bogglingly difficult to work out why, in many cases, things do not happen."" He was replying to a debate called by Mr Hollobone who had come up with some new figures about the extent of the problem. There are, he told MPs, 10,837 foreign national offenders in our prisons which make up 13% of the prison population. The highest number of offenders (938) come from Poland, followed by Ireland (779) and Jamaica (737). The cost of looking after them, he said was ""north of £300m"" a year. ""Such people need to serve their sentences in secure detention in prisons in their own country,"" he said. ""At a time of severe constraints on public expenditure, that is far too large a bill to ask British taxpayers to pay."" Mr Hollobone is particularly angry that many of these countries do not have prisoner transfer agreements with the UK. A compulsory agreement with Jamaica is still awaiting ratification by the Jamaican government, there is ""only"" a voluntary agreement with Pakistan and India and no agreement with Somalia or Bangladesh or several EU countries including Poland. ""Poland, which is top of the list with almost 1,000 of its nationals in our prisons, has a specific derogation from accepting prisoner transfers under that EU agreement until the end of December 2016,"" said Mr Hollobone. ""That is an absolute outrage. Poland should be securing those people in secure detention back in Poland, at the expense of Polish taxpayers."" He is also calling for the British government to use ""the huge and increasing international aid budget to build suitable prisons in countries that provide us with a large number of prisoners."" He has discovered that in 2012 we gave £973m in aid to Jamaica, Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Bangladesh who have a total of 2,900 of their citizens in British jails. ""It costs this country more than £100m a year to incarcerate these people in our jails. ""It would be a good idea to spend some of that £973m on building prisons in those six countries,"" he argued. Mr Penning admitted that he had been briefed by his officials ""to ensure that I stuck to the line and read the speech, which I will not do"". He went on to admit that he agreed with nearly everything Mr Hollobone had said: ""The frustration that he can hear in my voice was in his voice. I share his frustration."" The minister said he would like to see as many foreign nationals as possible serve their sentences in their country of origin and he added that it was important that ""our friends in Europe fulfil their commitments"". ""I agree that we have to work much harder because this matter has been ignored for too many years,"" he said.

"UK owners can get affected diesel vehicles repaired, but in the US they can also claim up to $10,000 (£7,400). The Transport Select Committee also said the government had been too slow to investigate whether VW should be prosecuted in the UK for the scandal. The government insisted it was pushing the firm ""to ensure they take action"". Louise Ellman, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said VW had ""acted cynically"" to cheat emissions tests. ""Volkswagen's evidence to us was just not credible but the government has lacked the will to hold VW accountable for its actions,"" she said. Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondent . Along with all the detail about VW, this report also highlights an issue raised recently by the BBC. It talks about the ""recent revelations"" that carmakers misled regulators or exploited loopholes in the regulations on a ""substantial scale"". Basically, the rules allow manufacturers to downgrade or switch off emissions cleaning systems at certain times to protect the engine. Testing figures suggest some are doing it when the outside temperature falls below about 17C, which is most of the year in Britain. They justify it by saying cold weather can damage components, but the suspicion is it gives them more miles to the gallon. It means the car is potentially more polluting than it needs to be, and we're talking millions of vehicles here. ""There is a real danger that VW will be able to get away with cheating emissions tests in Europe if regulators do not act."" The German giant will offer to repair or buy back the affected diesel vehicles in the US and pay owners between $5,000 and $10,000 in compensation. But in the UK, owners affected have only been offered the option of a repair. The select committee called on regulators to ensure owners were not left out of pocket by VW's technical solution, which it said was developed as cheaply as possible. Ms Ellman said: ""Vehicle owners have been refused goodwill payments. That is despite VW inflicting a great deal of uncertainty on its own customers, along with the prospect of declining residual values and the inconvenience of having to undergo repairs."" A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesman said it had taken VW's ""unacceptable actions extremely seriously"", adding: ""We continue to push VW to ensure they take action."" Volkswagen said it had contacted all 200,000 UK owners affected by the issue and advised them to take their cars to their closest dealer. ""Close to 50,000 vehicles in the UK have now received the technical measure, a number which will continue to increase as further vehicles' technical measures are developed, rigorously tested and then approved by the relevant transport authorities,"" a VW spokesman said. The MPs also said that the DfT failed to seek stricter emissions limits in new tests that will include real-world driving. ""We are concerned that manufacturers have far too great a say over how type approval reforms are implemented,"" Ms Ellman added. The DfT spokesman said the Real Driving Emissions test being introduced next year was ""robust and will make a real difference"". VW admitted last September that 482,000 of its diesel vehicles in the US were fitted with defeat device software to switch engines to a cleaner mode while they were being tested. It said that almost 1.2 million vehicles in the UK were affected, but disputed whether the software constituted a defeat device in the European Union. In May the company more than doubled its provisions for the diesel emissions scandal to €16.2bn (£12.6bn).",Volkswagen has been criticised by MPs for refusing to pay compensation to UK owners of cars rigged to cheat emissions tests.,[],"['The summary states that Volkswagen has refused to pay compensation to UK owners, but the text does not state that VW explicitly refused to pay compensation.

"Protesters shouted ""democracy"" and waved banners criticising planned changes to laws on surveillance. The measures would expand government access to digital data and allow for greater surveillance by police. The EU is investigating whether the new legislation violates its standards.

"Mohammad Javad Zarif told Tasnim news agency that he sent a tweet saying: ""Happy Rosh Hashana"". In a Twitter exchange that followed, he also distanced himself from the Holocaust denials of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It comes amid confusion over whether new President Hassan Rouhani also tweeted ""Happy Rosh Hashana"". A message came from a Twitter account thought to belong to Mr Rouhani earlier this week, but officials later said he did not have any such account. Iran has a Jewish community of up to about 30,000, according to some estimates, though much lower than the population which numbered about 80,000 prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution. The fact that Iranian leaders are congratulating Jews on the occasion of Rosh Hashana would not necessarily be controversial, say correspondents, but many in the international community are watching for signs that Mr Rouhani is seeking warmer ties with the West and Israel. Senior politicians are often the victims of Twitter hoaxes, whereby other web users set up fake accounts in their name. But in an interview given to Tasnim and published on Mr Zarif's Facebook page, the foreign minister confirmed he sent the ""Happy Rosh Hashana"" message because of Iran's Jewish community. By Rana RahimpourBBC Persian Service . The timing of these messages on Twitter may signal a shift in Iran's diplomatic discourse. A few weeks ahead of President Rouhani's trip to New York and Iran's first meeting with the IAEA since his election, it seems the new leadership is trying to present a more pragmatic and approachable side to the Islamic Republic. Furthermore, this rare instance of Iran's foreign minister using Twitter to respond to the daughter of a senior politician in the US, a country with which Tehran has had no diplomatic relations for three decades, means Iran is attempting to distance itself from the radical views of the last president. In summary, Iran's new administration appears keen to create a more benign atmosphere for negotiations. He then had a response from Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives, who said: ""Thanks. The new year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir"". He replied: ""Iran never denied it. The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year."" He was referring to Mr Ahmadinejad who, during his presidency, frequently claimed the Holocaust was a lie. ""We have condemned the killing of Jews by Nazis as we condemn [the] killing and crackdown on Palestinians by Zionists,"" Mr Zarif told Tasnim. Mr Ahmadinejad's anti-Israel comments and Tehran's controversial nuclear programme helped contribute to Iran's increased isolation in recent years. Iran has been the target of four rounds of UN sanctions and numerous UN Security Council resolutions calling on it to cease enrichment work amid fears it aims to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to obey, saying it intends to enrich only for power station fuel or other peaceful purposes. President Rouhani on Thursday announced that the foreign ministry would take over nuclear negotiations with the West from the Supreme National Security Council. The move makes it likely Mr Zarif - who has experience living in and negotiating with the West having served as Iran's envoy to the UN - will take over responsibility for the talks.

"Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said rock was dug away from cliffs near Bearreraig Bay in an apparent organised search for valuable specimens. The agency said Skye was known as Scotland's ""Dinosaur Isle"" because of its important fossil records. SNH has appealed for witnesses to contact the police. Skye is a key dinosaur fossil site in Scotland. Bearreraig Bay, north of Portree, is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A crowbar is suspected to have been used to prise away some of the rock. Dinosaur footprints may also have been removed from Valtos on Skye, SNH said. Evidence gathered at Valtos has been used by palaeontologists to explain what has been called the Dino Stampede in Australia, an incident where a group of dinosaurs were pursued by a predator. SNH said the Bearreraig Bay dig had been done without the landowner's permission or the consent of SNH, which manages the SSSI. Dr Colin MacFadyen, SNH's geologist, also said the actions went against guidelines in the Scottish Fossil Code. The codes does allow for the use of mechanical diggers, rock saws and even explosives for extracting fossils, but only when it was to the benefit of palaeontological research. Dr MacFadyen said: ""Fossil collecting is important for scientific and educational purposes, and is a popular hobby. ""It is better for fossils that fall from cliffs to be found, collected and enjoyed rather than be eroded and washed away by the tide. ""However, speeding up the process by large scale rock removal as in this alarming case is irresponsible and illegal, and also potentially dangerous to people as the cliff faces are undermined and destabilised."" Dr MacFadyen said permission to remove material from the SSSI would have been needed from SNH, but it had not been sought. He said fossil-rich rock had been damaged at the Bearreraig Bay site. Dr Neil Clark, of University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, has described Skye as one of the world's most important palaeontology sites. Its standing is underlined by the number of finds from the Middle Jurassic, about 170 million years ago. Dr Clark told the BBC News Scotland website: ""This is quite a shock. It is not something I have heard of happening before. ""Without knowing exactly where the damage is I can't say what they were after. It may have been plesiosaur."" He added: ""Whatever has been taken is now lost to science."" Finds on Skye have included the earliest turtles known to have lived in water. The 164-million-year-old reptile fossils were found embedded in a block of rock at the bay of Cladach a'Ghlinne, on the Strathaird peninsula. The new species formed a missing link between ancient terrestrial turtles and their modern, aquatic descendants.

"US biologists used homing pigeons to test the potential impacts of oil spills on birds' flight. ""Lightly oiled"" pigeons, they found, veered off course and took longer to return and longer to recover than birds with no oil on their feathers. The results are published in the journal Environmental Pollution. It is the first time that the effects of low level exposure to crude oil on long-distance bird flight patterns have been tested and suggests that even small amounts of oil could have serious impacts on migrating birds that are caught up in a spill. The researchers were surprised by their findings, as lead author Dr Cristina Perez explained: ""The general notion would be that these birds are 'fine', but in fact we found that even lightly oiled birds are not uninjured."" Dr Perez continued: ""We expected that the birds would have difficulties with flight and be slower in their arrival, but we did not expect such an obvious flight path difference."" The study used crude oil collected from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill which was applied onto the wing and tail feathers of some of the homing pigeons with paintbrushes. This pattern of oiling reflected that seen in wild birds from the spill. The pigeons were trained to repeatedly undertake flights of 161km between release points and their home loft, all the while carrying GPS data loggers. After release, most of the oiled birds took different flight courses which were longer in duration and distance than those of un-oiled birds. These longer flights, more than double the length of the un-oiled birds, avoided crossing lakes and made use of the updrafts from mountains. They chose to minimise the risk of overwater crossings and may have been using their knowledge of the environment to make the journey easier. Such options would be unavailable for migrant water birds that had become oiled on their first migration. Young birds, with their pre-programmed flight plans would have no idea of the environmental barriers, such as long overwater flights, that they would meet on their onward migration. Historically, the focus has been on understanding the impact on heavily oiled seabirds, but study co-author and project leader Prof Chris Pritsos stressed the importance of such work to understand the impact on lightly-oiled birds, which he pointed out ""were observed oiled but still alive and functioning"" after the Deep Water Horizon spill. Prof Pritsos stressed that these sub-lethal effects could seriously impact subsequent breeding attempts by migrant birds caught up in the spill. The team found that oiled pigeons failed to regain the body mass lost between flights, unlike the un-oiled birds. This is a bad sign for migrant birds as it suggests that they may not be able to refuel sufficiently on their migratory stopovers in order to continue their journeys. Oiled pigeons also delayed their journeys for longer than the un-oiled group; they even experienced physical difficulties in getting airborne. Dr Perez indicated that a combination of GPS data loggers and free-flying homing pigeons could be ""considered for testing the effects of other environmental contaminants"" for the sort of detrimental impacts that ""wouldn't be discovered in birds in a wind tunnel environment alone"". Dr Kees Camphuysen, an expert on the impact of pollution on seabirds at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Sea Research, who was not involved on the study, remarked that it was ""interesting that slightly oiled birds with only one task (fly home) were hindered and that the effect lasted fairly long"". Dr Camphuysen went on to stress that water birds are likely to be more badly affected by oiling than land birds like pigeons, as they will be unable to adequately clean their feathers when wet and matted at sea. The Deepwater Horizon spillage of 134 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico started on 20 April 2010. It was the biggest environmental disaster in US history and is estimated to have killed over one million birds. Dr Alexander Lees is a British Science Association media fellow at BBC Breakfast and a lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University.",The impact of oil on migrating birds has been tested for the first time.,"[""The summary states that the impact of oil on migrating birds has been tested for the first time, but the text specifies that it is the first time the effects of low-level exposure to crude oil on long-distance bird flight patterns have been tested, not the first time oil's impact on birds in general has been tested.

"Sterling has fallen sharply against the euro since the Brexit vote in June. It means fresh fruit, vegetables, fish, meat and poultry are costing more for traders to buy. The UK economy has defied some of the gloomiest predictions since the EU referendum. But with many businesses working out what the weaker pound means for them, BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme spoke to traders in New Smithfield Market in Manchester for their views. Tony Howard is a salesman for Barton and Redman Ltd, a large independent fruit and vegetable wholesaler at the market. He says tomatoes from the Netherlands have gone up sharply. ""Before Brexit the average price of a box of tomatoes was around £4 and now it is around £6,"" he says. He sells on to caterers, hotel and restaurant owners and secondary wholesalers. ""We try to work for a gross profit of around 10%, so if I am paying £6 for a tomato [box] I have to charge £6.60 for it,"" he says. ""Secondary wholesalers and catering people have to work for a larger margin because they don't do the volume that we do, so by the time it gets to somebody's plate that box of tomatoes could cost £10."" There were times before the UK voted to leave the EU when he could buy tomatoes from the Netherlands for £2, he says. BBC Radio 4's You and Yours spoke to several traders with similar stories - reporting price hikes of up to 40%. Brian Wilde is from J&B Wilde which has been selling fish, meat and poultry for more than a century. ""It is very difficult, because we buy quite a lot of produce out of the UK,"" he says. While imports are more expensive, of course the pound's fall also makes UK exports cheaper. But that also makes sourcing produce harder as well, says Brian. ""Produce in the UK is getting sent abroad because it's worth more for those fishing for the fish to send it abroad."" His sister, Mariella, says: ""All our prices, for anything from outside this country, have gone up. Our average profits have fallen by up to 15%. We cannot pass that on."" Traders say they try to absorb as much of this extra cost as they can but that might change soon. Darryl Laycock, from Sale Fish and Seafood in south Manchester, says the price of his sea bass has gone up 10%. ""I haven't passed it on yet, but I think the margins are getting so tight, I am going to have to start looking at different prices on certain products,"" he says. Traders suggest this could also affect the availability of products. Matthew Tunaley, who runs a greengrocers at Failsworth in Manchester, says he does not buy strawberries at New Smithfield Market because they are asking for £5 for 500g.

"During July - the first full month after the Brexit vote - 60,912 new mortgages were approved. That was down from 64,152 approvals in June, and was the lowest total since January 2015.

The number of approvals has been falling steadily since March, when there was a rush to buy ahead of tax changes. ""Mortgage approvals for house purchases have progressively slowed after being buoyed in the first quarter by buy-to-let and second home sectors rushing to beat April's Stamp Duty increase for these sectors,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. ""It is also highly possible that mortgage activity was hit in July by heightened uncertainty following June's vote for Brexit.""

"Groups pushing for the impeachment of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff are using a large rubber duck as a mascot. But the design is similar to one by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, who told the BBC the Brazilian replica constitutes copyright infringement. The owner of the factory that produced both ducks denied any wrongdoing. Versions of the same giant inflatable rubber duck designed by Mr Hofman have travelled the world since 2007, calling in Japan, New Zealand and Brazil, among many other countries. The version that has appeared in protests in Brazil closely resembles Mr Hofman's, although it has crosses for eyes. It also has the slogan ""Chega de pagar o pato"" across its chest, a Portuguese expression meaning ""We won't pay for the duck any more"" or ""We won't pay for what is not our fault any more"". The giant duck was commissioned by a powerful Brazilian industrial group, FIESP, to use in protests against corruption and high taxes from last September. But it has made a number of appearances in demonstrations against the president in recent months. ""It is exactly our design and our specific technical patterns,"" Mr Hofman told BBC Brasil. ""Changing the eyes doesn't change our technical design of the shape and beak."" Before it appeared as part of an exhibition in Brazil, a version of Mr Hofman's duck was produced in a Sao Paulo factory. The owner of the factory, Denilson Sousa, told the BBC they also produced the new duck, but said the design was not copied. ""I would not put our reputation at risk,"" he said. ""We have experience in this kind of job and this is a very simple design. Why wouldn't we spend four hours redesigning it?"" But Mr Hofman said the factory ""made a very unwise decision"" and that he considered it ""illegal use of the exact design and therefore copyright infringement"".

"Sailor Victor Magnus captured the scene when a ship carrying explosives caught fire in Halifax, Canada, resulting in the deaths of 2,000 people. The explosion, on Thursday 6 December 1917, almost wiped out the town. Mr Magnus's daughter, Anne Foreman from Cornwall, is to take the pictures to the Imperial War Museum in London. It was 09:04 (GMT) when Halifax suffered the world's greatest man-made explosion at the time, when the two ships involved in the war effort collided. Standing on the shoreline was Royal Navy Lt Victor Magnus. The French ship SS Mont Blanc, which was loaded with wartime explosives, collided with the Norwegian vessel SS Imo. The cataclysmic explosion occurred after a fire broke out on SS Mont Blanc, all of which was caught on camera by Mr Magnus. SS Mont Blanc was described as a huge 'floating bomb' because of her formidable cargo. There were more than 2,000 tonnes of picric acid, 200 tonnes of TNT, 56 tonnes of gun cotton and 223 tonnes of motor fuel on board. Records show the ship exploded and disintegrated in seconds. Altogether 3.8 sq km (1.5 sq miles) of Halifax was flattened and more than 1,900 people perished. Avid photographer Mr Magnus managed to capture plumes of smoke and a town littered with ash in his photographs. After the war Mr Magnus had three children. His daughter, Anne Foreman from Hayle, Cornwall, decided to share her father's photographs during the anniversary of the outbreak of World War One. She said: ""This has brought him to life again. It's amazing, it brings tears to my eyes. Ms Foreman, aged 89, said her father was on watch during the morning of the explosion when he took the pictures. ""The blast absolutely blew Halifax town into oblivion, the whole of the harbour and the town was devastated. ""The thing that struck me most was a cannon that was blown three miles in land. Ms Foreman said her father was ""a kind and lovely man with a great sense of humour"". ""There are so many things I've found out about him and his experiences from these photographs. I'm so happy he's been brought back to the forefront of our minds,"" she said.",Photographs of the world's worst man-made explosion during World War One are to go on display for the first time.,"['The summary states the photographs are to go on display for the first time, but the text does not mention anything about the photographs being displayed or it being the first time.']",[],0

"Amama Mbabazi, a former prime minister, is quoted as saying that the move would help reconcile Ugandans divided over the legacy of Amin and other leaders. Mr Mbabazi is running against President Yoweri Museveni in next week's polls. Amin's rule was notorious for its brutality. He was overthrown in 1979 and died in exile in 2003. An armed forces chief under President Milton Obote, Amin seized power in a coup in 1971. He ordered the expulsion of Uganda's Asian community a year later. He became infamous for his capricious behaviour and for his punishment of political opponents. Some 400,000 people are estimated to have been killed while he was in power. Amin fled Uganda in 1979, seeking refuge in Libya, Iraq and eventually Saudi Arabia, where he would remain for the rest of his life. Mr Mbabazi made his promise to repatriate Amin's remains on a visit to the former dictator's ancestral home in north-west Uganda. His spokeswoman said his party was campaigning for reconciliation and for the ""forgiveness for any real or perceived wrongs in the past"". ""The issue of Idi Amin is one of them,"" she told the AFP news agency. Mr Mbabazi meanwhile told the state-owned New Vision newspaper that he wanted to end ""the labelling of Ugandans"" as Amin's people, Obote's people and Museveni's people.

"Walsall had to play most of the game a man down after Joe Edwards' 16th-minute sending-off, but Jason McCarthy gave them the lead nine minutes later and Etheridge kept Bolton at bay. Wanderers almost took the lead after 13 minutes but Jamie Proctor's looping header from a Chris Taylor cross clipped the bar. Edwards was shown a straight red card three minutes later for elbowing Taylor as the pair jumped. However, the 10 men of Walsall went in front after 25 minutes as Bolton keeper Mark Howard flapped at Kieron Morris's free-kick, allowing McCarthy to bundle home into an empty net. The away side almost levelled two minutes later but Lewis Buxton's header was cleared off the line by Andreas Makris. And as Bolton turned the screw in the second half, Etheridge made superb saves from two close-range David Wheater headers, a 20-yard Taylor drive and Proctor's 12-yard half-volley.

"In mid-May, Gen Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's Civil Defence Organisation, said he saw the mainly Sunni kingdom as his chief threat in the coming year. Mainly Shia Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals but tensions worsened dramatically last year, partly because of the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. Within days of Gen Jalali's remarks, Iranian and Saudi hackers were attacking websites in each other's countries in what Iranian media called ""all-out cyberwar"". On 25 May, a self-proclaimed hacker from Saudi Arabia calling himself ""Da3s"" apparently attacked the websites of Iran's Statistical Centre and Registration Office, defacing the homepages with a photo of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who fought an eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s. Many Iranian media sources thought the hacker had misspelled his name and that the attack was the work of the Sunni jihadist group Islamic State - widely known in the Middle East by its Arabic acronym, ""Daesh"". The Saudi hacker said on Twitter - where he identified himself as Salman al-Harbi - that he was not a member of the militant group, and that Da3s was the correct spelling of his nickname. Since the Stuxnet computer worm hit Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010, the country has invested heavily in cyber capabilities and set up a team of trained hackers known as the Iranian Cyber-Army. Saudi Arabia has also stepped up its investment in cybersecurity in the past year in efforts spearheaded by its National Centre for Cyber-Security. A day after Da3s's attacks, a group calling itself ""Iran Security Team"" retaliated by targeting Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Statistics and King Abdulaziz University, defacing their websites with a jeering message of its own. Another team of Iranian hackers, calling themselves ""Digital Boys Underground Team"", hacked the Saudi Commerce Ministry's website. Over the next few days, a series of apparently tit-for-tat attacks saw more websites targeted, almost all of which were defaced or rendered inaccessible by attacks. Iran's police and cyber-police force, its judiciary, national postal service and culture ministry were all targeted. There is no evidence that official organisations in either state have been directly involved in the attacks. Iran's cyber-police chief, Gen Kamal Hadinafar, said the hackers' IP addresses had been traced back to Saudi Arabia but he did not accuse the Saudi authorities. As the attacks continued, the messages left by hackers became increasingly political and hostile. Tension between the two countries rose further when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shia cleric and opposition figure in January. Protesters in Tehran ransacked and set alight the Saudi embassy. Riyadh responded by severing all diplomatic ties with Iran. With relations at an all-time low, Tehran announced a few days ago that it would bar its citizens from attending this year's Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) after negotiations over safety broke down. Last year, more than 400 Iranian pilgrims had died in a stampede, leading to a war of words between Iranian and Saudi officials. After hacking the website of Iran's foreign ministry, a hacker group calling itself ""Team Bad Dream"" branded the Iranian government the ""mother of terrorism"" and demanded an end to the ""killing of children in Iraq, Yemen and Syria"". The group tweeted that a ""cyberwar"" between Iranian and Saudi hackers had begun. In his latest attacks, Da3s pointed to the Yemen conflict and castigated the Iranian authorities for boycotting the Hajj. ""Why is Iran forbidding Muslims from attending this year's Hajj? Relations between states are unrelated to freedom of religion!"" Iranian hackers hit back by highlighting the long-standing dispute over the naming of the Gulf. Some Arab states refer to the body of water as the Arabian Gulf, but many Iranians see the name Persian Gulf as a source of national pride and object to any other form of words, including ""the Gulf"".

"Recep Tayyip Erdogan said voters had chosen stability following unrest. With almost all ballots counted, state-run Anadolu news agency said the AKP had won 49.4% of the vote, with the main opposition CHP on 25.4%. European observers have criticised the government for stifling media freedom. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said violence, especially in the country's south-east, had also had a significant impact on the election. Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) went further and denounced the entire process as ""unfair"". President Erdogan hailed the result early on Monday, saying: ""The national will manifested itself on 1 November in favour of stability."" But he also attacked media criticism of him and called for global recognition of the election result. ""Now a party with some 50% [of the vote] in Turkey has attained power... This should be respected by the whole world, but I have not seen such maturity."" Gavin Hewitt: President's triumph leaves Turkey polarised . Erdogan: Turkey's bruised battler . Lira strengthens after result . Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu will now begin the process of forming a new government. Mr Erdogan called the second general election this year after his AKP lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years in June and attempts to form a coalition failed. The pro-Kurdish HDP crossed the 10% threshold needed to claim seats in parliament, but it got 21 fewer MPs than in June's election. The nationalist MHP's share of the vote also declined, to 11.9%, and commentators suggested it had lost voters to the AKP. Reported results also showed: . Clashes were reported in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, in the south-east of Turkey, as the results were being counted. Reuters said police had fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones. Since elections in June, a ceasefire between the Turkish army and militants from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has collapsed. Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of renewing violence to curb support for the HDP - something the government denies. In a statement on Monday, Ignacio Sanchez Amor, head of the OSCE observer mission, said: ""Physical attacks on party members, as well as the significant security concerns, particularly in the south-east... imposed restrictions on the ability to campaign."" He added that pressure on journalists - including a police raid on the Koza-Ipek media group in Istanbul last week - was a major concern. Meanwhile Andreas Gross, head of the PACE delegation, said: ""Unfortunately, the campaign for these elections was characterised by unfairness and, to a serious degree, fear."" HDP co-chair Selahattin Demirtas said on Sunday that it had not been ""a fair or equal election"". The party suspended campaigning after a bombing in Ankara last month killed more than 100 people. The government said the attackers were linked to the Islamic State (IS) group. Violence has escalated in Turkey since a suicide bombing in July by suspected IS militants. The attack near the border with Syria killed more than 30 Kurds. Turkish newspaper front pages reflect the contrasting euphoria and gloom from government supporters and opponents at the election result. ""Ballot box revolution"" declares Sabah, echoed by Aksam's ""November revolution"". Pro-Islamist papers are equally jubilant, with Yeni Safak hailing a ""magnificent victory"", and Yeni Akit offering ""congratulations to the Muslim world"".

"John Whittingdale was speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show after launching a debate on what types of programmes the BBC should make. Of Strictly, he said: ""The BBC took a risk. It paid off well and it has achieved a mass audience. ""And that seems to me admirable if you can do all those things."" The government published a Green Paper on the future of the BBC on Thursday, including the question of whether the corporation should be ""chasing ratings"" or delivering ""distinctive, quality"" programmes that are unavailable on other channels. That has led to some suggestions that the BBC could stop showing Saturday night light entertainment programmes. Asked about the difference between Strictly and the BBC's long-running Generation Game, Mr Whittingdale said: ""Saturday night has always been a time when families sit around the television and we traditionally have had light entertainment shows. ""In many ways, Strictly Come Dancing is the successor to The Generation Game. ""But Strictly was perhaps, at first sight of the commissioning editor, not necessarily a show which was going to be as successful as it has proved to be. ""So I think the BBC took a risk. It paid off well and it has achieved a mass audience. And that seems to me admirable if you can do all those things. ""But, of course, in the age when you and I were sitting watching The Generation Game, the amount of choice available was extremely limited. ""At that time there were probably only about three channels, whereas now you've got 50, 60, 70 to choose from."" Before becoming culture secretary, Mr Whittingdale had told the Guardian newspaper that it was ""debatable"" whether there was a public service argument for the BBC making Strictly. The show should certainly not compete for viewers with X Factor on ITV, he told the paper. On Sunday, Mr Whittingdale told Andrew Marr he was a ""huge admirer"" of the BBC. But he said he was ""a little surprised that the BBC expressed such disappointment at the Green Paper"". He said the document was ""just a series of questions with no answers as yet decided"". Almost 30 celebrities, including Daniel Craig and Dame Judi Dench, have signed a letter warning against creating ""a diminished BBC"". But some of the signatories have revealed that they were asked to sign by BBC executives. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgend told the Sunday Express the BBC's director of television Danny Cohen should resign over the matter because it broke the BBC's lobbying guidelines. In his interview on Sunday, Mr Whittingdale did not refer to the row but said he ""fully agreed with"" most of the letter's contents. He added: ""I admire the BBC.

"Staffordshire bull terrier Butch was labelled ""dangerous"" by Merseyside Police after he was found eating the corpse in 2015.

Judge Nigel Bird has now ordered a review of the seizure order and fairness of the court hearing. The precise cause of Butch's owner's death remains unknown. The force assessed whether the animal, which is not a banned breed, presented a danger to others and concluded it did. A judge sitting at Liverpool Magistrates' Court agreed and ordered the dog's destruction in April 2016.

""Regardless of what you might choose for yourself, why should you deny others the right to make this choice?

There is no specific legislation in South Africa governing assisted dying. But in a landmark ruling in April 2015, a South African court granted a terminally ill man the right to die, prompting calls for a clarification of the laws in cases of assisted death. The Anglican Church - of which Mr Tutu is a member - is staunchly against assisted dying. This is not the first time Mr Tutu has come out against the church, however. He is an outspoken supporter of gay rights, and has openly criticised conservative Christian attitudes to homosexuality.

The Bristol Safeguarding Children Board's report said there was a system for controlling entry to the ward ""but mothers and babies were allowed free access throughout the hospital"". It went on to say that, ""this allowed CB [Charlotte Bevan] to leave the ward with ZBM [Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck] unnoticed and unchallenged"". The report said once the alarm was raised that Ms Bevan and her four-day-old daughter were missing, there was a quick response. However, it said the safeguarding concerns were ""everybody's business"" as Ms Bevan was ""able to walk outside at night, in unsuitable clothing, carrying a newborn baby, in a public place unchallenged by anyone"". Since their deaths, the report said ward security had been ""reviewed and improved"" and changes had been made to the reception area. Charlotte's mother Rachel Fortune, who contributed to the review, said in a written statement ""no single thing, action or person was to blame"". In the statement, released jointly with her daughter Janet, she said there were eight main findings which offered ""clear, constructive learning"", including how to manage long-term mental health in pregnancy, ""honest, accurate and timely communication"" and how several agencies could work together with a lead clinician. She added: ""This was a particularly difficult case to manage as long-term ill mental health and pregnancy came together. It's our hope now that any families and individuals facing such difficulties will have a multi-agency team with accountable clinicians in each service, as they now do in Bristol."" The review also found Ms Bevan's explanation for stopping her medication due to breastfeeding concerns was not followed up with a pharmacist until after she had given birth. She later revealed she had not been taking medication for the last five months of her pregnancy, which the review team speculated was a sign of ""disguised compliance"". The report said: ""It is notable that it was not until CB [Charlotte Bevan] had given birth to ZBM [Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck] that any professional contacted a pharmacist to confirm the safety of her medication on ZBM when breastfeeding or otherwise."" There was also confusion over who was leading, co-ordinating and overseeing Charlotte's overall care, the report found. In some cases, it found, health professionals assumed it was the Mother and Baby Unit Doctor, the mental health care co-ordinator or her GP. The report also found there was confusion over the terminology in describing her mental health condition. It found that describing her as ""well"" meant there was no clarity in what this meant in mental health terms. Independent chair of the Bristol Safeguarding Children Board, Sally Lewis said: ""This review provides constructive learning for many agencies and professionals working in Bristol and beyond. ""A great deal has already changed in local professional practice since this tragic incident, some of which has been influenced by the findings of this review and has been noted by the Board in our formal response.""","A mother and her newborn baby were ""unnoticed and unchallenged"" as they walked out of a hospital, a report has found.",[],[],0
"A Russian defence ministry statement said the Turkish vessel approached to 600m (1,800ft) before turning away in response to Russian small arms fire. The Turkish military attache in Moscow has been summoned to the foreign ministry over the incident. Relations remain tense over Turkey's shooting down of a Russian bomber. The Russian SU-24 bomber was shot down by two Turkish F-16s in the Turkish border-Syria area on 24 November. Turkey maintained the plane crossed into its airspace, although Russia disputes this. And last week, Turkey complained over what it said was a sailor on a Russian naval ship brandishing a missile launcher as the vessel passed through Istanbul. Russia rejected the criticism saying the crew had a ""legal right"" to protect the ship. 24 November - A Turkish F-16 fighter jet shoots down a Russian Su-24 attack aircraft, allegedly because it violated Turkish airspace. Russia denies the claim and insists the aircraft had been in Syrian airspace. A Russian pilot is killed parachuting from the jet, and a Russian marine is killed in a subsequent rescue mission. 28 November - With Turkey refusing to apologise over the incident, Russia announces a package of economic sanctions against Turkey, including restrictions on imports and travel . 6 December - Turkey condemns Russian ""provocation"" after Turkish media publish showing a Russian serviceman holding a rocket launcher aboard a warship passing through the Bosphorus. 13 December - Russia fires ""warning shots"" at a Turkish fishing vessel that it says was approaching its warship in the Aegean Sea.

""Despite numerous attempts by the crew of the Smetlivy, the crew of the Turkish fishing boat did not make radio contact and did not respond to visual signals by semaphore or warning flares,"" the ministry said in a statement. To prevent a collision, ""small arms were fired in the direction of the Turkish vessel from a range that is not lethal"". The ministry said that ""immediately after that the Turkish vessel drastically changed course"" and passed within half a kilometre of the Smetlivy, still making no contact with the Russian crew. Russia's deputy defence minister has summoned a Turkish military attache, the statement said. Turkey has not yet given its response to the incident.

"Scottish Children's Services Coalition made the call after ""disappointing"" waiting times for appointments were revealed in the region. Figures show in the Lothians 15% of children had to wait more than a year. Less than half of the 665 children referred were seen within the target of 18-weeks. Two years ago the Scottish government set a target for Mental Health services that 90% young people should be seen within 18 weeks. The figures for treatment from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) relate to the period between October and December 2016. A spokesperson for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition, a network of support groups, said: ""The figures from NHS Lothian indicating that more than half of those who started their treatment between October and December had been waiting more than the Scottish government target of 18 weeks is clearly disappointing. ""In addition, of the 101 children and young people in Scotland who had been waiting for more than a year before they started treatment, these almost all relate to NHS Lothian. ""We know that half of all diagnosable mental health problems start before the age of 14 and 75% by the age of 21. ""As such it is vitally important that an action plan is put in place for NHS Lothian, radically improving mental health services and increasing investment in these, with an overall aim of ensuring that children and young people get the help they need, when they need it. ""A target of 18-weeks is in itself still far too long. ""Families usually experience months of waiting even before a referral to CAMHS. ""The consequent delay in diagnosis and appropriate support can lead to a crisis situation for the child or young person concerned, as well as for their family, and the need for costly extra resources to address this. ""We hope that NHS Lothian takes account of these figures and takes urgent action to address this matter."" Alex McMahon, NHS Lothian's executive director of nursing, midwifery and allied health professionals, said: ""More young people than ever before are accessing mental health services and we have seen a steady rise in the number of children and young people being referred to our services. ""Unfortunately patients are having to wait longer than we would like and we are working hard to reduce this number. ""We have invested significantly in CAMHS over the years to support the delivery of expert services for children. We are confident they will be strengthened through integration of education, social and health services. ""Our CAMHS team is working on an agreed action plan to reduce the length of time children and young people are waiting and we have approximately 200 less children and young people waiting more than 18 weeks as a result and are confident we will see further significant reductions in waiting times over the coming months.""","Campaigners have called on NHS Lothian to ""radically improve"" mental health services for children and young people.",[],"['The summary states that campaigners have called for improvements, but the text specifies that the call was made by the Scottish Children\'s Services Coalition, which is a network of support groups, not generic ""campaigners.""

"The decision comes after a report by the UN cultural agency Unesco said the area ""should be off-limits to commercial logging in its entirety"". The Tasmanian Wilderness covers about a fifth of the island and is one of the world's last big temperate forests. Conservation groups have welcomed the Unesco report and the logging decision. In 2014 the Australian government asked the agency to revoke the special status of the forest to open up parts of it to logging in order to boost the island's economy, where unemployment is above the national average. But the move - by the government of former PM Tony Abbott - attracted much opposition from environmental groups. The Unesco report released on Saturday said the organisation ""does not consider a World Heritage property recognised for its outstanding cultural and natural values the place to experiment with commercial logging of any kind"". The Tasmanian Wilderness is home to ancient forests, some of the tallest flowering plants in the world and is a stronghold for several animals that are either extinct or threatened on Australia's mainland.

"Over six years, the Tackling FGM Initiative has given Â£2.8m of funding to community-based prevention schemes. It said in a report that the funding had helped spark a necessary debate about FGM. But it added that maintaining momentum would be difficult without more money. The initiative was set up by five charitable trusts, including Comic Relief, to discourage the cutting of girls' sexual organs. As well as funding the work of dozens of community groups, the money also paid for the training of more than 6,000 teachers and healthcare staff in how to spot and respond to the illegal act of female genital mutilation. Under the scheme, people were encouraged to work within their own communities. For example, a Somali elder in Bolton recruited other men in his community to emphasise the need to protect their daughters. But the Tackling FGM Initiative's report said there was still a lack of clarity over who should be funding future FGM prevention work. It said local authorities, health and wellbeing boards, and public health or clinical commissioning groups all had a part to play. The report says it is difficult to measure the success of preventing FGM because of the lack of data about an illegal procedure, but, using surveys, it found attitudes to FGM had changed. It concludes that awareness of FGM has increased, particularly among women, and there has been a strong focus on educating young people from a wide range of communities. But the report warns that funding is still the major barrier to ending mutilation and the authors say, in the current financial climate, it will be difficult to maintain progress. It said: ""There is good evidence that the community-based approach has worked with a range of audiences within communities affected by FGM and has started to create a critical mass of people who are opposed to the practice.""","Funding is still the major barrier to ending female genital mutilation (FGM), a charity says.","['The summary states that a charity says funding is the major barrier, but the source text attributes this statement to the Tackling FGM Initiative, which is not described as a charity.']",[],0

"Only 1,338 spectators turned up for the EFL Trophy second-round tie against Crawley Town, which they won 1-0. League gates have already dipped this season, with an average attendance more than 3,000 down on last season. Sky Blues fans are unhappy at the way their club is run by owners Sisu. Only one and a half stands were open at the 32,609-capacity stadium for the game against Crawley, with just 57 away fans making the trip. The crowd was lower even than the 1,603 who watched City's game against Carlisle United in February 2014, during their season at Sixfields, Northampton - the club's previous lowest ever 'home' crowd. Although attendance figures initially rose when City left Highfield Road for the Ricoh Arena in 2005, interest in the club has been decreasing steadily over the past decade, especially since relegation to League One in 2012. The Sky Blues are in their fifth campaign in the third tier of English football - and only once has their average seasonal attendance increased in that time - last term's relatively successful campaign, when they briefly led League One under Tony Mowbray before falling away to finish eighth. Under interim manager Mark Venus, they are currently in the relegation zone, in 21st place, after four straight league defeats. Relegation would take the club to their lowest place in the Football League since winning promotion from the old Division Four in 1959. City fans, who boycotted home games in the year at Northampton, have become increasingly dispirited this season. At the recent home fixture against MK Dons, they staged a mock funeral procession ""in affectionate remembrance of Coventry City Football Club which is dying due to neglect and abuse at the hands of Sisu from 2007 to 2016"". They also joined in with equally disaffected Charlton Athletic supporters in the joint 'pigs might fly' pitch protest in the away match at The Valley in October. Coventry have had some success in the Football League Trophy, reaching the two-leg Northern final in 2012-13, before going out in the Southern semis in 2014-15. However, there appears to be less interest generally in this season's revamped competition, and Coventry's two previous home ties this season each attracted just over 2,000 fans. But prior to this season, City's average home attendance in the Trophy was 12,284. 2012-13: Beaten Northern section finalists . 2013-14: Knocked out in second round (no home tie) 2014-15: Beaten Southern section semi-finalists . 2015-16: Knocked out in second round (no home tie) 2016-17: Last 16 .",Coventry City have recorded their lowest ever home crowd at the Ricoh Arena.,[],[],0
"Ms Saunders will head the Crown Prosecution Service when Keir Starmer stands down in October. The career CPS lawyer has overseen some of the country's most important prosecutions and is currently the organisation's London chief. The DPP is the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, responsible for more than 6,800 staff. By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News . The role of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is critical within the criminal justice system of England and Wales. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is the organisation that can deliver justice by making independent decisions as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect, and when it decides that there is, by prosecuting the case effectively. It works closely with the police but must always be seen to make independent and dispassionate decisions based upon the evidence gathered. It can only prosecute when it concludes that there is sufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction, and that the prosecution is in the public interest. The DPP is the hands-on, day-to-day head of the CPS - which is currently negotiating a period of austerity and modernisation. Maintaining public confidence in it will be critical. The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, said: ""Alison will make an excellent director of public prosecutions and is the right person to help the Crown Prosecution Service meet the challenges it will face in the coming years. ""I am particularly pleased that Alison is the first head of the CPS to be appointed from within its ranks as proof of the high quality of the professionals that work within the service. ""I'd also like to thank Keir Starmer for the great contribution he has made - not only to the CPS but more generally to the criminal justice system. He can be proud of the reforms that he and his staff have led to keep our criminal justice system one of the best in the world."" Ms Saunders said: ""I am delighted and privileged to be appointed as the next director of public prosecutions. To lead an organisation of committed and professional staff is an honour, especially having worked for the CPS since its inception."" Ms Saunders spent the early part of her career prosecuting in south London before working on CPS policy in relation to child victims and witnesses. In 2001 she became chief crown prosecutor for Sussex and oversaw the prosecution of Roy Whiting for the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne. She then briefly left the CPS to join government as a deputy legal adviser to the attorney general. On her return, she set up the CPS organised crime division which deals with complex cases including human trafficking, drugs, counterfeiting and money laundering across borders. In 2009 Alison Sanders was named chief crown prosecutor for London, which deals with more than 200,000 cases a year. She oversaw the successful 2012 prosecution of two of the men who attacked and killed Stephen Lawrence in 1993. She also oversaw the huge number of prosecutions in London in relation to the August 2011 rioting, which led to 1,000 people being jailed.",Alison Saunders has been appointed as the next director of public prosecutions.,[],[],0

"Taking comfort from the fact that, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the UK leads the world for care of people in the final weeks of their life is perhaps a more appropriate reaction. The UK topped the table when the EIU last carried out this exercise in 2010. But the number of countries included has been doubled to 80 in this latest survey, commissioned by the Lien Foundation of Singapore. So for the UK to again lead the pack, including all other wealthy nations, is significant. In essence, the UK scores so highly for the care of patients nearing the end of their life because the NHS is such a well-integrated service. Health professionals, ranging from hospital doctors to GPs and community nurses, generally work together effectively to ensure patients receive the end of life care they might expect. This includes pain management through palliative care. This is not the case in many international healthcare systems. The report praises the UK for having a comprehensive strategy with the NHS working alongside the hospice movement and charities such as Marie Curie and Macmillan. Ensuring that people get to live out their final days in a place of their choice is an area where there has been progress in recent years. Its interesting that both the report authors and other experts in the field have gone out of their way to stress there is still plenty of scope to do better. The Health Ombudsman in England recently highlighted cases where people were badly let down and experienced death without dignity. Future demand, the report says, is likely to be higher as people live longer and the burden of cancer, dementia and diabetes increases. While noting the report's findings are ""very encouraging"", the Health Minister Ben Gummer said the Government was determined to go even further to ensure patients and families were involved in decisions about care. The crossbench peer Baroness Finlay has introduced a Palliative Care Bill which will be debated in Parliament this month. The aim she says is to guarantee all patients equal access to services around the clock and regardless of geography. But she acknowledges that, helped by each of the UK's health administrations having a strategy, there has been improvement. ""We are vastly better than we were - patients are rating good services very highly though the problem is gaps in provision at ground level,"" she says. The hospice movement, she told the Today programme is ""setting a gold standard and leading the world"". Its important to give praise where praise is due. In this sensitive area, its easy to assume from anecdotal reports that the NHS could do a lot better. So to score more highly than Australia and New Zealand, as well as Germany, France and the US is highly commendable. Richer nations inevitably lead the pack with the Philippines, Bangladesh and Iraq propping up the table. Affordability of care, with a taxpayer funded health service, is predictably a lot more bearable for British patients than in other economies. The NHS, the hospices and a range of dedicated professionals should be given a pat on the back. Specialist training and expertise is highlighted by the report, along with successful national policies. We can be reassured that the quality of death in the UK is as high as we might feel it ought to be in a civilised society.",It is easy to assume from anecdotal reports that the NHS could do a lot better.,[],[],0
"Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said it would be ""ready as soon as we receive a list of the opposition delegation"". The warring parties and the world powers backing them have to agree on which rebel groups will be designated as ""terrorists"" and not represented. The UN hopes to convene the talks in Geneva towards the end of January. More than 250,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. More than 11 million others have been forced from their homes. ""Syria is ready to participate in the Syrian-Syrian Dialogue in Geneva without any foreign interference,"" Mr Muallem told reporters in Beijing on Thursday following a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. ""We hope that this dialogue will be successful to help us in having a national unity government,"" he added. Mr Wang said the Chinese and Syrian governments had agreed on three principles that ""should be upheld throughout the whole peace process"". ""We should stick to the peaceful resolution of Syrian issue, the people of Syria should decide the future and fate of Syria, and the UN plays a key role in negotiations,"" he added. On Friday, the UN Security Council unanimously backed a resolution endorsing a road map for the peace process, including negotiations, a ceasefire and elections. But the resolution avoided contentious issues, including who could represent the opposition at the peace talks and the fate of Mr Assad. Mr Wang declined to answer directly when asked if Mr Assad should remain in power. ""China's position is very clear. We believe Syria's future, its national system, including its leadership, should be decided and set by the people of Syria."" The United States, which supports the Syrian opposition, wants a negotiated settlement based on the 2012 Geneva Communique, which calls for the formation of a transitional governing body. It says President Bashar al-Assad must go. Russia, which launched an air campaign against Mr Assad's opponents in September, also calls for the implementation of the Geneva Communique. But it says Mr Assad's future is for the Syrian people, not external powers, to decide. Most of Syria's political and armed opposition factions now agree on the need for a managed transition but they demand that the president leave at the start of it. Bashar al-Assad says peace talks cannot begin until ""terrorism"" is eliminated and that his departure is out of the question before elections are held.

"Trade talks after leaving the EU will need more UK officials with language skills, say the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Modern Languages. There is already a languages skills shortage but currently the UK can rely on other EU nationals ""to plug the gap"", say the group. Ministers say their reforms are already boosting language learning in schools. Launching a checklist on Brexit and languages, the group say lack of language ability loses the UK an estimated 3.5% of economic performance. The country currently relies on the EU to negotiate trade deals but this will no longer be possible once the UK has left the Union, they add. APPG co-chair Baroness Coussins said: ""Brexit must make the UK's language skills a top policy issue. ""Language skills are vital for our exports, education, public services and diplomacy."" Baroness Coussins called for ""a national plan to ensure the UK produces the linguists we need to become a world leader in global free trade and on the international stage."" The group identify a need to boost skills in both European and non-European languages for the purposes of trade, international relations and security. In particular, they fear the loss of European language skills if EU nationals already living in the UK are not guaranteed residency status post Brexit. They also want the UK to continue full participation in the Erasmus+ scheme, where young people study, work volunteer and train abroad in Europe, some working as language assistants in schools. The checklist includes calls to: . ""It is essential that schools continue to be able to recruit EU nationals post-Brexit,"" said Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. ""There is already a critical shortage of language teachers and the last thing that we need is anything which makes this situation worse. ""We understand that Brexit means Brexit but it is vital that it does not also mean a full-blown crisis in language teaching."" Mike Buchanan, head of Ashford School and chairman of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference, said independent schools were proud of their ""increasingly central role in ensuring the survival of languages in British universities"". ""But more is needed to reverse this trend. The national situation is parlous,"" said Mr Buchanan. Sara Davidson, head of modern languages at the private Oundle School and chairwoman of the Independent Schools Modern Languages Association, said she did not know of a language department that did not employ native speakers. ""Native speakers are helping us out amidst a major recruitment crisis in modern language teaching. ""We simply do not currently produce enough linguists in this country to fill the modern language teaching vacancies we have.""

"The total population is now estimated to be less than 500 breeding pairs. The situation is even worse south of the border where the iconic bird of prey is said to be heading to the brink of extinction. The latest survey found 460 breeding pairs in Scotland in 2016 compared with more than 500 when the previous study was carried out six years earlier. The RSPB, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Scottish Raptor Study Group, along with a range of other UK partners carried out the survey. It found Scotland remained a major stronghold for hen harriers, with 80% of the UK population. However, having a breeding population of fewer than 1,000 birds makes the species vulnerable to the effects of habitat degradation and, in some areas, wildlife crime. The west Highlands continue to provide a home for the majority of Scotland's breeding harriers, while Orkney and the Hebrides were the only areas of the country to show a slight increase in the number of the birds. A major project aimed at maintaining their population has also been carried out at Langholm Moor in Dumfries and Galloway. Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management at RSPB Scotland, said: ""The hen harrier is an indicator of the health of our upland environment, and the fact that its population continues to decline is of major concern. ""The hen harrier is a high priority for our conservation work and urgent steps need to be taken to tackle illegal killing of this species and to improve their moorland breeding habitats."" Eileen Stuart, SNH's head of policy and advice, said the decline was a ""serious concern"". She said they were committed to working with others to tackle wildlife crime throughout the country. ""There is a very concerning trend of a long term decline in the number of breeding hen harriers in Scotland,"" added Wendy Mattingley of the Scottish Raptor Study Group. ""For the population to begin to recover and expand over all suitable habitat, the intensively managed grouse moors of east and south Scotland must produce successful breeding hen harriers again. ""The hen harrier is a wonderful spectacular raptor and more action must be taken to ensure that its future is secure."" Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group, said the decline was disappointing but said it would be working to better understand the reasons behind poor breeding and help to rebuild the harrier population. Simon Wotton, lead author of the study, described the survey as a ""monumental effort"". ""We hope these results will convince everyone in a position to help hen harriers to take positive steps to ensure their protection and rebuild the country's population for people to enjoy for generations to come,"" he said.","Scotland's hen harrier population has continued to decline, according to a new survey.",[],[],0

"It follows the revelation that the Church of England has dropped its opposition to gay clergy becoming bishops if they agree to stay celibate. The Reverend Martin Reynolds says his friend Jeffrey John, the Dean of St Albans, has been made a ""whipping boy"" in the row. He told Radio Wales it would be great if he could now become a Welsh bishop. Dr John, from Tonyrefail in Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been at the centre of the row over gay bishops having twice been put forward for the role in the Church of England. In 2003 he declined the position of Bishop of Reading in the face of protests from traditionalists. He was also rejected as a candidate for the Bishop of Southwark in 2010, with evidence emerging it was because of his sexual orientation. On Friday, however, it was revealed that after a decision taken last month the Church of England would allow gay men in civil partnerships to become bishops as long as they promise to be celibate. Unlike the Church of England, the Church in Wales has never had a ban on gay clergy in civil partnerships becoming bishops. Mr Reynolds, an Anglican priest in Newport, claimed the reason the moratorium in the Church of England was introduced 18 months ago was because Dr John was about to become Bishop of Southwark. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""Rowan [Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury] didn't want another furore ... they shafted Jeffrey yet again - introduced this rule that you couldn't be in a civil partnership which of course Jeffrey is with Grant [Holmes, a hospital chaplain]. ""Poor old Jeffrey's been more than just a whipping boy - he's been assassinated really several times."" Asked if there was now any realistic chance of his friend becoming a bishop in the Church in England, Mr Reynolds said: ""Wouldn't it be nice if he became a bishop in the Church in Wales?"" He added that gay clergy in civil partnerships in Wales are not asked ""if we do anything naughty in bed"". Asked about the question of policing the celibacy of gay clerics, Mr Reynolds said he believed honour still exists in the church. ""When Jeffrey said he and Grant weren't actually sleeping together anymore I think we all believed him. ""I don't think there was a single person ... that I ever spoke to said Jeffrey wasn't telling the truth."" Mr Reynolds also praised the Church in Wales approach on the celibacy issue. ""In Wales we've never bothered, we've never tried,"" he said. ""Our bishop has never introduced any such a role and, of course, we know that the archbishop of Wales has said if there was a gay man who was in a relationship who was nominated, he'd be happy to ordain him.""","A gay clergyman has been ""assassinated"" in the row over gay bishops, his friend has claimed.",[],[],0
"About 12 students stormed the offices of LSE director, Sir Howard Davies Students and 150 held a rally outside. The LSE says it is reconsidering links with Libya ""as a matter of urgency"". But the students demanded the university paid back the £300,000 it had accepted of a £1.5m grant from a charity wing of the regime. The grant was pledged in 2009 by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. The funds have so far been used to develop a research programme on North Africa, focused on politics, economics and society. The student demonstrators called on the LSE management to ""repay"" the £300,000 already spent by creating a scholarship fund for underprivileged Libyan students. The students also urged the university to revoke the LSE alumni status of Libyan leader Col Gaddafi's second son Saif al-Islam, who studied at the university from 2003 to 2008, gaining both a Master of Science degree and a doctorate. They called for a public commitment that no grants from officials ""of such oppressive regimes"" would be accepted in the future, as well as a public statement denouncing the recent ""gross violations of human rights"" by the Gaddafi regime. One of the protesters, Ashok Kumar, who is also education officer for the LSE students' union, said: ""I think it's reprehensible that the university continues to benefit from money that was stolen from the Libyan people and it's only right to return it to the people who are now being murdered in the streets fighting for their freedom."" The money should be returned either as scholarships to underprivileged students, or ""to the families of those who have been murdered and who continue to be murdered"", he said. In a statement, the university said the LSE Director ""noted the message"" from the students. ""He shares the students' revulsion at the recent violence and gross violations of human rights in Libya, and much regrets the association of the School's name with Saif Gaddafi and the actions of the Libyan regime. ""The School's statement of 21 February made clear that School engagement with the present Libyan authorities, covering a number of programmes, has already finished or has been stopped following the events of the weekend of 19-20 February."" The university said no more of the £1.5m donation from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation would be accepted. It said about half of the £300,000 already accepted had been spent and its council would now consider what to do with the remaining funds, taking into account the views of LSE students. The LSE's review of its links with Libya follows a speech made by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi on Sunday, in which he said the regime in Libya would stand firm.

"The UN Office on Drugs and Crime said land used for opium had risen by 17% this year, from nearly 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) to 51,000 hectares. Burma is the second largest opium grower in the world after Afghanistan. Almost all of the opium it produces is grown in Shan and Kachin states, which have seen longstanding conflict between the military and ethnic rebel groups. Citing figures from the Burmese government, the report said almost 24,000 hectares of poppy fields had been eradicated in 2012 - about four times the figure in 2011. Gary Lewis, UNODC representative in South East Asia, said the situation on the ground was ""very complex"". In areas where opium was grown, there was ''a toxic combination of guns, money and drugs'', he said. The army and rebel fighters often profit from allowing the trade to continue. Farmers, meanwhile, say the instability means they have little choice but to continue growing the lucrative poppy plant - which is used to make heroin. Burma accounts for 25% of opium grown in the world, while Laos accounts for 3%, said the report, entitled the South East Asia Opium Survey 2012. In Laos, land used to grow opium increased almost four-fold between 2007 and 2012 to 6,300 hectares. The recent rise contrasts with the situation from 1998 to 2006, when both Burma and Laos saw big drops - with an 83% reduction in the case of Burma. Most of Burma's opium is refined into heroin - about half goes to meet the growing market in China, with the rest being sold across South East Asia. Part of the reason for the sustained growth in the cultivation of this crop is the demand for heroin in Asia, said the report. But the good news, in the case of Burma, was that there was now ''momentum to find the solution'', Mr Lewis said. There is support from President Thein Sein's government, which has embarked on a series of reforms. Ceasefires and political opening up also meant that international organisations such as the UN now have better access to the areas. The Golden Triangle - where Burma, Thailand and Laos meet - has been notorious for opium and drug smuggling for decades.","The cultivation of opium poppy in Burma and Laos has risen sharply, according to a UN report.",[],"['The summary states that the cultivation of opium poppy in Burma and Laos has risen sharply, but the text only mentions a 17% increase in Burma and does not quantify the increase in Laos as ""sharp.""

"Last month, Lidl said it would introduce a living wage of £8.20 an hour, or £9.35 an hour in London. But Northern Ireland staff were not included at the time, with Lidl saying this was due to the way its business was organised. Lidl has now reversed that position. The company added that a similar pay commitment is being made to staff in the Republic of Ireland. Susan Fitzgerald, a regional officer with the Unite union, welcomed the company's decision. ""This is a very significant victory for Lidl workers, our members and Unite, who led the campaign to demand equal pay for workers in Northern Ireland,"" she said. ""We are particularly pleased that Lidl's adoption of the living wage will extend to their workforce in the Republic of Ireland. ""This announcement means other retail chains are now on notice that they need to pay the living wage - there can be no justification for poverty-pay."" Earlier this year, the government announced there would be a new, compulsory National Living Wage of £7.20 an hour from April 2016. But that figure is lower than the £8.20 recommendation set by the independent Living Wage Foundation. It is the rate calculated by academics as the level of pay that will give workers enough for a basic standard of living. It is an informal benchmark, not a legally enforceable minimum level of pay. Lidl has received plaudits for becoming the first UK supermarket to implement the independently recommended living wage. But its position in Northern Ireland became a PR disaster with some consumers threatening a boycott and trade unions planning protests outside shops. John Paul Scally, the managing director for Lidl in Ireland, said the majority of staff already earn above the living wage. ""It is important for us to ensure that those whose hourly pay falls below £8.20 benefit from a substantial increase,"" he said. ""This would bring them to a level that is more reflective of enjoying a better standard of living."" Lidl staff at store assistant level in Northern Ireland currently start at a basic £7.20 an hour. Now all store assistants will earn a minimum of £8.20, rising to £8.80 an hour incrementally within three years. Mr Scally said the move will require an investment but he wanted to reassure customers that it will not lead to price increases.

The Scottish government said the review was held before a significant testing phase of the project had taken place. The project is more than two years behind schedule. It is also currently running 55% over budget with an estimated cost of £117.4m, £41.6m higher than planned. NHS 24 has already borrowed £20m from the Scottish government in order to cover the escalating costs. Since the August 2013 Programme and Project Management Centre of Expertise review it has emerged that nobody read through the contract before it was put out to tender. This meant that vital performance measures were left out. On 2 December, MSPs on the Scottish Parliament's Public Audit Committee gasped as they were told that ""human error"" was to blame for a poorly worded contract. Key parts were not copied over to the final version, which meant that contractors were not obliged to meet important performance measures. Committee members described the mistakes as ""incredible"". The following week the Scottish government's most senior policy advisor, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, told the Public Audit Committee: ""I would expect team in charge to be clear about what they were signing up to and that the document was fit for purpose."" Committee convener Paul Martin MSP put it to Mrs Evans that he had signed loan agreements for much less than £75m and they always contained the phrase ""please read carefully"". Mrs Evans said: ""Common sense, apart from anything else, would emphasise the importance of reading the document that one signs."" It has now emerged that the project was recommended in an internal report as something which could be ""transferable to other programmes"". A Scottish government spokesman said: ""This is a dated review, carried out at a specific point in the project on behalf of NHS 24. ""It was held before a significant testing phase of the project had taken place. ""Since that point, in February 2014, the Scottish government and NHS 24 jointly commissioned Ernst & Young to undertake a review and report of the situation with the Future Programme."" In October, call-handlers had to resort to pen and paper when the new computer system, designed by BT and CapGemini, ran into ""technical difficulties"". NHS 24 is using its old system until the problems have been resolved. The new IT system is not expected to be ready for use until next summer. Every month the new system is not in place, NHS 24 incurs additional costs of £450,000. In a statement NHS 24 said: ""This was a complex contract process, which took several years to develop and resulted in very substantial 600-page documents. ""The board had a range of governance measures in place, but this was not sufficient and the risk to the organisation was underestimated at the time. ""While the ultimate responsibility for spending public money lies with the accountable officer, the contractual flaws were part of a systemic failing involving a variety of people."" It added: ""Once the new system is re-launched in 2016, it will bring significant benefits to the way we can serve the needs of patients for many years to come."" CapGemini and BT declined to comment.","NHS 24's troubled new IT system was recommended in an internal review as ""something which could be transferred to other programmes"".",[],[],0
"The share price fall extended a decline that started almost immediately after Snapchat started trading on the stock market this spring. The firm reported 173 million daily users, up 4% on the prior quarter. But the company is struggling with fierce competition from Facebook, which offers similar features. Snap's stock, which was priced at $17 for its public offering in March, is now trading at less than $14. On Thursday, chief executive Evan Spiegel pledged that he and fellow co-founder Robert Murphy would not sell any of their own shares this year, as a sign of confidence in the firm's prospects. The shares were worth billions at the time of the IPO. ""We believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap,"" he told analysts on a call after the results were released. Snap made its name as a messaging app, with texts that would disappear. It now offers video stories, maps and other features. The firm said it is working to woo advertisers with low prices and evidence that its ads are working - features it hopes will set it apart from rivals. Revenue over the three months to the end of June was $181.7m, more than double the same period in 2016. But expenses grew even faster, reaching more than $630.6m for the quarter, including expenses related to stock-based compensation. Snap's user base increased by more than 20% year-on-year. But the firm added just seven million new users in the quarter, compared to eight million in the first three months of the year. Shares in the firm fell more than 14% in after-hours trade. Mr Spiegel said the company was making ""a lot of progress"". He estimated that a quarter of people with smart phones in the US, UK and France use Snapchat every day, with users typically spending more than 30 minutes daily on the site. Snap is not the only young company that has stumbled after going public while facing off with one of the tech giants. The prepared meal company Blue Apron, which started trading in June, has also lost much of its value. Analysts say Amazon's plan to acquire Whole Foods, combining its delivery strength with a well-known grocer, has dimmed its prospects. On Thursday, in its first earnings report since its stock market debut, Blue Apron reported more than $238m in revenue for the three months to the end of June and losses of $31.6m. Its shares fell more than 17%, to $5.14, compared to $10 price set at the IPO.","Shares in Snap, the owner of messaging app Snapchat, fell more than 14% after the firm reported slower-than-expected growth.","['The summary states that Snap reported slower-than-expected growth, but the source text does not mention any expectations or whether the growth was slower than expected.']",[],0
"This is the principle that all websites and apps should be equally accessible. Travel portal Cleartrip.com and media giant Times Group both announced they would be withdrawing from the service, citing competition fears. But Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg defended Internet.org's aims. The service aims to extend internet services to the developing world by offering a selection of apps and websites free to consumers. Telecoms firms absorb the data costs associated with handling Internet.org traffic. But many companies fear this distorts the market and makes it harder for small companies to get their products seen by the public. Currently, Indian visitors to Internet.org can access nearly 40 stripped-down services, including job, healthcare, news and education sites. Times Group blogged that it was appealing ""to all publishers to jointly withdraw from Internet.org"" and said that the Times of India newspaper would also withdraw ""if its direct competitors - India Today, NDTV, IBNLive, NewsHunt, and [the] BBC - also pull out"". The BBC has yet to respond to the call. A Times Group spokesman said: ""We support net neutrality because it creates a fair, level playing field for all companies - big and small - to produce the best service and offer it to consumers. ""We will lead the drive towards a neutral internet, but we need our fellow publishers and content providers to do so as well, so that the playing field continues to be level."" Cleartrip said the debate around net neutrality had given it ""pause to rethink"" its approach to Internet.org. ""What started off with providing a simple search service has us now concerned with influencing customer decision-making by forcing options on them, something that is against our core DNA,"" wrote Subramanya Sharma, Cleartrip's chief marketing officer. In India, the issue hit the headlines this week after telecoms provider Bharti Airtel said it would allow mobile app developers to pay data charges enabling users to access the apps for free. Start-up developers with little funding could therefore be at a commercial disadvantage, tech firms argue. Facebook launched Internet.org in India in February after partnering with Indian telecom carrier Reliance Communications. India has the world's third-largest internet population and is the first Asian country to get the service. Mr Zuckerberg defended the initiative in an article for the Hindustan Times newspaper, saying: ""Net neutrality is not in conflict with working to get more people connected. ""We will never prevent people accessing other services, and we will not use fast-lanes.""",Two Indian companies have pulled out of Facebook's Internet.org service in protest over net neutrality.,"['The summary states that two Indian companies have pulled out of Internet.org, but the text only explicitly mentions Cleartrip and the Times Group, and does not confirm that both are Indian companies.']",[],0
"An Â£8m scheme has been unveiled for the home, where Lennon played as a child. The venture will combine an education centre for young people with learning difficulties and an exhibition on the home, the song and Lennon's early life. The gates at the site, which is closed to the public, are a popular attraction for Beatles fans visiting Liverpool. The plans were announced on the 50th anniversary of the release of the single, which was a double-A side with Penny Lane, reaching number two in the UK charts and number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the USA. The original home in Woolton was demolished in the early 1970s and replaced with a smaller building. Major Drew McCombe, divisional leader for the North West branch of the charity, said: ""Strawberry Field is special in the hearts of many people in Liverpool, the UK and across the world, and we at the Salvation Army are aiming to redevelop the site to do justice to the many people that have been supported by the children's home or formed a connection with the iconic Beatles song."" According to Blue Badge Beatles tour guide Neil McDonald, the gates are one of the must-see Beatles sights in the city. He said: ""It is a unique atmosphere. I've seen some people burst into tears and even proposals of marriage."" According to Hunter Davies's biography of The Beatles, one of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party that took place each summer on the grounds of Strawberry Field. His Aunt Mimi recalled: ""As soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting, John would jump up and down shouting 'Mimi, come on. We're going to be late.'"" The musician is said to have found a place of peace and refuge from his troubled childhood in the woods around the home, where he went to play with friends, climb trees and dream the hours away. The song's refrain ""and nothing to get hung about"" is said to be a reference to Lennon's retort ""they can't hang you for it"" to Mimi about playing on the property. Official fundraising for the project begins later this year.","John Lennon's childhood home, Strawberry Field in Liverpool, is to be redeveloped by the Salvation Army.","[""The summary states that Strawberry Field was John Lennon's childhood home, but the text specifies that it was a children's home where Lennon played as a child, not his actual home.

"The international team analysed 77 genes. Individually they each had a low impact on cancer risk, but were a powerful combination. The findings, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, could eventually transform screening, preventive treatments and even HRT. Cancer charities said the field was developing rapidly. The genetic tests that have already been developed are restricted, in the UK, to those women with the very highest risk of developing breast cancer. They look for changes such as mutations in the BRCA genes that led the Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie to have her breasts and ovaries removed. They can give up to a 90% chance of cancer in a woman's lifetime, but are rare. The team, led by the Institute of Cancer Research in London and the University of Cambridge, looked at the parts of the genetic code that have a more subtle effect yet will influence every woman's chance of cancer. Of the 77 cancer-risk sites in the DNA inherited from the mother and the matching 77 from the father, an average woman would have 66. It allowed the team to calculate the probability of women developing breast cancer. ""These are quite substantial risks,"" said Prof Montserrat Garcia-Closas, of the Institute of Cancer Research. She told the BBC News website: ""I think it's very exciting at the moment. The discovery of these variants has progressed very quickly in the last five years and I think it's reaching a plateau. And at that point it's time to start designing a genetic test that includes all these elements. That's likely to be reached within a year."" The ability to accurately predict the risk of breast cancer could have a powerful impact on medicine. It could clearly show which women need drugs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, to reduce the risk of breast cancer. The lowest-risk women may not need breast cancer screening, while those at highest risk might need to start earlier. Hormone replacement therapy has many benefits, but it does increase the risk of cancer. So knowing the background genetic risk could also inform who should and should not have HRT. But one of the great challenges will be to combine these tests with current techniques. Prof Douglas Easton, of the University of Cambridge, said: ""We've now reached a crucial stage at which all this research can be combined to help target screening and advice to those women who need them the most. ""There's still work to be done to determine how tests like this could complement other risk factors, such as age, lifestyle and family history, but it's a major step in the right direction that will hopefully see genetic risk prediction become part of routine breast screening in the years to come."" Dr Matthew Lam, of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ""In recent years we've learnt so much about genetic risk factors of breast cancer. What's great to see now is that these findings are starting to be translated into practical methods to predict risk."" Nell Barrie, of Cancer Research UK, said: ""This study shows how the genetic map of breast cancer that scientists have been building up over the years might be used to identify women most at risk, so we can take steps to reduce their chances of developing the disease or catch it at the earliest possible stage.""",Scientists say they have unlocked the genetic secrets of breast cancer.,[],"['The summary states that scientists have ""unlocked the genetic secrets"" of breast cancer, but the text does not claim this.

"Government plans would give applicants a right to complain to an employment tribunal if they believed they had suffered discrimination. Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to create ""a culture of openness"" where staff feel they can speak up about patient safety. Barrister Sir Robert Francis recommended the measure after a public inquiry into Stafford Hospital deaths. Protecting NHS whistleblowers was a key recommendation from the inquiry into the scandal, which resulted in the trust that ran Stafford Hospital being fined Â£500,000 for ""basic"" blunders linked to the deaths of four patients. Sir Robert, the inquiry chairman, warned that staff often faced bullying and isolation if they tried to speak out and that staff struggled to find new jobs in the NHS. Under the UK-wide plans, applicants for an NHS job would have the right to complain to an employment tribunal if they had been discriminated against because they had previously raised concerns about the safety of patients. Applicants would also have the right to bring a claim in court in order to prevent discriminatory conduct. And the draft guidelines, which are out for consultation, say that discrimination of an applicant by an NHS worker should be treated like discrimination by the NHS body itself. Health Secretary Mr Hunt said: ""Today we move another step closer to creating a culture of openness in the NHS, where people who have the courage to speak up about patient safety concerns are listened to, not vilified."" He said the changes would ensure ""staff feel they are protected with the law on their side"". There has been a growing focus on patient safety since Sir Robert's inquiry in 2013. One of the main findings of that report was that people within the NHS had known about the poor levels of care at the hospital, but did not raise the alarm. Since then, a number of initiatives have been launched to improve safety. In 2015, the government introduced plans to appoint guardians to support staff who wanted to speak up about concerns over patient safety. Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents, said the plans were modest, but a ""welcome move in the right direction"". ""It is clearly unfair that staff who have been forced to become 'whistleblowers' should be discriminated against when they seek alternative jobs. ""However, this is a symptom of a much deeper cultural problem in the NHS which will not be solved with tinkering with rules here and there. ""So far we have not seen a joined-up approach to supporting and protecting staff from unfair treatment when they try to do the right thing and end up having to be whistleblowers."" Mr Walsh said many NHS trusts had still not appointed guardians, as recommended by the Stafford Hospital inquiry. The current consultation is open for eight weeks and will close on 12 May.",NHS workers who raise concerns about patient safety could be protected from discrimination under plans announced by the health secretary.,[],[],0
"Performers dressed as cartoon characters popular in the west were seen dancing on state TV, along with violin players in miniskirts. Pyongyang has long taken pains to keep popular culture out of its media. This seems to be the first time that Disney characters have been featured in the reclusive state. A Disney spokesperson told the Associated Press news agency that it had not licensed or authorised the use of the characters in the show. 'Grandiose plan' The concert was staged by the Moranbong band as its debut performance on Friday, reported state media KCNA. The band was put together by Kim Jong-un, who has a ''grandiose plan to bring about a dramatic turn in the field of literature and arts this year"", state media said. North Korean entertainment has traditionally featured nationalist or folk songs, and mass displays. In recent years, reports say, children in the isolated country have become familiar with characters such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh through stationery items and clothes imported from China, North Korea's closest ally. It seems to point to an easing of North Korea's paranoia about what it calls spiritual pollution from the West, and even more dangerously, South Korea, says the BBC's Charles Scanlon. It is still illegal to watch South Korean television programmes in North Korea. But a recent report based on interviews with refugees said that North Koreans now have more access to outside media, especially DVDs of popular South Korean drama serials. The young leader, who took power following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il in December 2011, has been seen as attempting to make changes to the profile of the North Korean leadership. Mr Kim, believed to be in his late 20s, made his first public speech in April, in a 20-minute televised address as Pyongyang marks the centenary of the birth of the country's founder, his grandfather, Kim Il-sung. Kim Jong-il is thought to have made one recorded public utterance in his 18-year rule - and that was a single sentence.","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has watched a concert featuring Disney characters, state media say.",[],[],1

"It said the ""irresponsible"" advert for meal delivery service Diet Chef implied happiness and self-confidence could only be achieved through weight loss. The advert featured a woman, Cheryl, before and after using the service. Diet Chef said the advert showed her sense of achievement after taking control of her lifestyle. It said the actor who played both versions of Cheryl had a Body Mass Index of 27.4 when she played the earlier version, which was in the overweight category. In the advert, the later Cheryl tells her former self: ""I know how you feel; you can look that good again, you know,"" and ""I bought a bikini last week, for the first time since this picture."" The former Cheryl says: ""You look amazing. I never dreamed I could be that slim again."" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received complaints from 26 viewers objecting that the advert was irresponsible for exploiting women's body insecurities by implying that they needed to be slim to be happy. Complainants also said it implied that overweight women did not take care of themselves or how they looked. The former Cheryl was shown wearing a baggy shirt and had messy hair, while the current, happier Cheryl had a more polished appearance. Diet Chef said the ad showed the frustration of the former Cheryl, who did not feel able to make a change in her lifestyle or to maintain a controlled diet and so was surprised that she had done so, and the sense of achievement of the later Cheryl. It also said the advert's approach was typical of the ""before and after"" genre commonly used to advertise weight loss products. The ASA said the advert did not give the impression that former Cheryl had neglected her personal appearance and said viewers would be unlikely to find this part of the advert offensive. But it said the character's unhappy demeanour while talking about wearing a bikini appeared disproportionate to concerns about her weight, especially as she did not appear to be particularly overweight. The ASA said the advert ""implied that weight loss was the only solution to her problems"". It went on: ""It therefore implied that those with insecurities about their bodies, and particularly their weight, could only achieve happiness and self-confidence through weight loss. ""We therefore concluded that the ad presented a socially irresponsible approach to body image and breached the code.""

"Sgt Elor Azaria, 20, shot Abdul Fatah al-Sharif, 21, in the head while he was lying immobile on a road. The incident happened in Hebron in the occupied West Bank last March, after another soldier was stabbed. Sgt Azaria said he thought Sharif might have an explosive vest, but prosecutors said his motive was revenge. The high-profile trial has proven extremely divisive in Israel, says the BBC's Yolande Knell in Tel Aviv. There have been rallies to support the soldier and some senior politicians backed Sgt Azaria. However, top military figures were quick to say that his actions did not reflect the values of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). In the incident on 24 March, Sharif and another 21-year-old Palestinian, Ramzi Aziz al-Qasrawi, stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier before troops opened fire on them, wounding Sharif and killing Qasrawi. Footage of the scene several minutes later, filmed by a Palestinian and released by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, shows Sharif alive. A soldier, identified as Sgt Azaria, is then seen cocking his rifle and fatally shooting Sharif from several metres away. In their indictment, prosecutors said Sgt Azaria ""violated the rules of engagement without operational justification as the terrorist was lying on the ground wounded and represented no immediate threat for the accused or others who were present"". Delivering the verdict on Wednesday, the panel of three military judges rejected Sgt Azaria's defence that he shot Sharif because he continued to pose a threat. He had told the court that he believed there might be a suicide belt under the Palestinian's jacket. The judges, who took two-and-a-half hours to deliver their verdict, noted that Sgt Azaria's company and battalion commanders had testified that he did not mention the same concerns when they questioned him immediately after the shooting incident. The judges also said there was no dispute regarding the veracity of the statements made by another soldier, who testified to military investigators that Sgt Azaria had told him during the incident: ""They stabbed my friend and tried to kill him - he deserves to die."" Sgt Azaria told the court that he did not recall having any such conversation, but the head of the judging panel, Col Maya Heller, described him as an ""unreliable witness"". ""His motive for shooting was that he felt the terrorist deserved to die,"" she said. Prosecutor Lt Col Nadav Weissman said: ""This is not a happy day for us. We would have preferred that this didn't happen. But the deed was done, and the offence was severe."" A spokesman for Sgt Azaria's family said evidence proving his innocence had been ignored. ""It was like the court was detached from the fact that this was the area of an attack,"" he said. The soldier's mother, Oshra, shouted at the judges: ""You should be ashamed of yourselves."" The defence team has said it will appeal against the verdict. Sentencing is expected in the next few weeks. Manslaughter in Israel carries a maximum 20-year term. Sharif's father Yusri was quoted as saying Sgt Azaria deserved a life sentence. Sharif's uncle, Fathi, told Haaretz that the decision to try him for manslaughter rather than murder was ""a perversion of justice and of the court"". Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who expressed support for Sgt Azaria before taking office in May, said the verdict was ""difficult"" and that the defence establishment would ""do everything it can to assist the soldier and his family"". But he also called on the public to respect the court's decision. Sari Bashi, Israel advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, described the verdict as ""a positive step toward reining in excessive use of force by Israeli soldiers against Palestinians"". The shooting happened during a wave of knife, gun and vehicle ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs in Israel and the West Bank that has killed at least 42 people since September 2015, according to the Israeli authorities.

"Chief prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand said police were ""98% sure"" that the man was Iraq-born Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly. Abdaly, 28, is believed to have died minutes after setting off a car bomb on Saturday. Two other people were hurt. Seven US FBI bomb experts are heading to Stockholm to help the investigation, Sweden's intelligence agency said. Although Abdaly was a Swedish citizen, he had been living in the UK. British police have been searching a house in Luton, north of London, where Abdaly lived. Mr Lindstrand said Swedish police were now trying to work out what the bomber's target had been before he blew himself up prematurely. ""He had a bomb belt on him, he had a backpack with a bomb and he was carrying an object that has been compared to a pressure cooker. If it had all blown up at the same time, it would have been very powerful,"" he said. A car containing gas canisters blew up first in a busy shopping street in the area of Drottninggatan at 1700 local time (1600 GMT) followed minutes later by a explosion in a street about 300m (985ft) away that killed the bomber. Abdaly was named as the registered owner of the car. Mr Lindstrand said they believed the bomber had intended to kill ""as many people as possible"". ""Where he was headed... we don't know,"" he said. ""It is likely that something happened, that he made some kind of mistake [and] part of the bombs he was carrying went off and caused his death. ""This was during Christmas shopping in central Stockholm and he was extremely well-equipped when it came to bomb material. It is not much of a stretch to say he was going to a place with as many people as possible."" Mr Lindstrand said possible targets included the city's central train station or to Aahlens, a popular department store. In a profile on the Muslim dating website Muslima, Abdaly said he was born in Baghdad and moved to Sweden in 1992, before arriving in the UK in 2001 to study. He said he had got married in 2004 and had two young daughters. ""I want to get married again, and would like to have a big family. My wife agreed to this,"" he wrote. Mr Lindstrand said Abdaly was completely unknown to Swedish security services before the blasts. However, he pointed out: ""He didn't live in Sweden; he lived in the UK. He left Sweden maybe 10 years ago."" Meanwhile, British police have been searching Abdaly's house in Luton. His wife and children are reported to live in the UK, although their exact whereabouts are not known. It has emerged that Abdaly had attended the Luton Islamic Centre but left after other members accused him of having a ""distorted view"" of Islam. A Swedish news agency has released an audio recording apparently made by Abdaly, in which he says oppression against Muslims in Europe will not be tolerated. He refers to drawings of the Prophet Muhammad and to the presence of foreign soldiers - including Swedes - in Afghanistan. If confirmed as a suicide bombing, the attack would be the first of its kind in Sweden. In pictures: Stockholm blasts . Sweden's Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt has said the attacks are unacceptable in Sweden's ""open society"", which he said was a democracy that respected different cultures.

"There's no doubt he's getting back to his best form just in time for his fourth final, but he's striking a blow against sexism in tennis too. In early 2014, Murray split with his then coach Ivan Lendl - who'd helped Andy become a Grand Slam champion. His decision to replace Lendl with Amelie Mauresmo prompted more than a few raised eyebrows. Never before had a top male player hired a woman as coach (except for Jimmy Connors but the woman in charge of his game was his mother Gloria, so it doesn't count). The early signs for the new partnership weren't good. Murray appeared to be slipping back into some bad habits, playing defensively and berating himself in the process. Despite a late season surge, 2014 was Murray's most forgettable year since establishing himself as one of the ""Big Four"". Had Murray continued his iffy form into the Australian Open, there's no doubt the vultures would have been circling over the Murray-Mauresmo axis. But they'll have to wait as his early season form is arguably better than ever. His play against Tomas Berdych had Mauresmo's finger prints all over it - full of variety and controlled aggression. It was certainly Grand Slam-winning form, and if he can keep it up a first Australian Open title is definitely on the cards. ""A lot of people criticised me for working with her,"" Murray said in his on-court interview. ""So far this week we've shown that women can be good coaches as well."" Mum Judy has always played a strong role in Andy's career, and she hailed the impact Amelie was having off the court, describing her as a ""calming influence"". Many male players have been dismissive of the women's game, albeit not as noisily as in the past. The 1996 Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek famously dismissed 80% of the women's tour as ""fat pigs"" in 1992. Last year, Rafael Nadal's uncle Toni criticised the appointment of a woman as Spain's Davis Cup captain. ""Men's tennis isn't the same as women's tennis,"" he said.

""Reflecting the ways in which our viewers consume Channel 4 content across digital and mobile platforms, our relationship with YouTube will now focus on short-form content,"" it says. The move ends the previous deal Channel 4 had with the online streaming service, where its 4oD catch-up service was available on YouTube's UK site.

"Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust said funding offered by central Norfolk clinical commissioning groups (CCG) does not meet the ""volume of demand"". A trust board meeting was told the CCGs were ""not commissioning sufficient capacity"" in beds or staffing levels. The central Norfolk CCGs said they were still in negotiations. At the meeting Andrew Hopkins, director of finance, said funding arrangements had been agreed with all its CCGs apart from central Norfolk. The meeting heard the plans put forward by central Norfolk CCGs did not provide enough funds for out of area placements, when no beds can be found in the area. There were also issues surrounding staffing levels. In previous years, the trust has been criticised over the need to send patients outside of Norfolk and Suffolk due to a shortage of mental health beds. The BBC revealed that in November last year the cost of sending Norfolk and Suffolk mental patients to other parts of the country almost tripled to Â£600,000, from an average of Â£200,000 a month in December 2013 to September 2014. In December, the trust said the number outside the counties had been cut to 24 from a high of 50 earlier in the year. Non-executive director John Brierley said: ""The issue is the commissioners are not commissioning sufficient capacity to the volume of demand."" If no agreement is made the dispute will go to arbitration where a final decision is made by NHS England and health watchdog Monitor. Trust chief executive Michael Scott said after the meeting: ""We don't think there is adequate funding for mental health. It remains the Cinderella service. ""In some areas such as Suffolk and Great Yarmouth and Waveney we have managed to agree funding. ""Unfortunately across central Norfolk we are unable to agree and we have to go to arbitration.""

"The move will take it past the current high street leader, William Hill, combining Ladbrokes' 2,100 shops with Coral's 1,845. Current Ladbrokes chief executive, Jim Mullen, will become boss of the merged company, named Ladbrokes Coral. The two firms had announced merger talks last month. Peter Erskine, chairman of Ladbrokes, hailed the merger as a ""major strategic step for Ladbrokes"". He added: ""Together, we will create a leading betting and gaming business. The transaction will provide an attractive opportunity to generate considerable value for both sets of shareholders."" The best way at looking at the challenges facing the merged betting giant of Ladbrokes and Coral is that they have tried to merge before. In 1998 that planned deal was squashed by Peter Mandelson, the trade and industry minister at the time, on the grounds that it would dominate the industry. Yet at that time the biggest threat to Ladbrokes and Coral did not even exist. Betfair is the world's largest internet-based betting exchange and it was not founded until 2000. It is only one of a huge number of online betting companies that pay lower tax bills, can compete for business both here and around the world and face few of the fixed costs of owning thousands of shops on the British High Street. The rationale behind this merger is to create a company that will stand a better chance of competing with those online giants. To fund the deal Ladbrokes will offer 93 million new shares to investors, representing 10% of the company. Gala Coral has been owned by a number of private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management, Cerberus Capital Management, Anchorage Capital Partners and Park Square Capital, since 2010, when it collapsed under £2.5bn of debt. Under the terms of the deal, those private equity owners will own 48.25% of the new company's shares, with the remainder being held by Ladbrokes shareholders. Ladbrokes shares closed down 3.3% at 124.1p. Before the merger talks began, Gala Coral had appointed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to advise on a possible stock market debut, initially planned for October. The deal comes just over a week after online bookmaker 888 Holdings won a takeover battle with GVC Holdings for rival Bwin.party in a cash and shares deal valued at about £898m.","Bookmakers Ladbrokes and Gala Coral have agreed a deal to merge, creating the UK's biggest betting and gaming group.",[],[],0

"Gwynedd council is a considering charging a premium on holiday homes. Councillor Jason Humphreys, however, fears the authority will lose out as people sidestep the charge by classing their second homes as self-catering businesses. Gwynedd said it was powerless to stop owners making the change. Some Welsh councils have voted through hikes in council tax charges for second homes, including Anglesey and Pembrokeshire, with other councils still consulting on a change. Since 2006, the number of self-catering units in Gwynedd has risen from 78 to 968. Changes to the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 mean councils have the ability to charge a premium on top of the existing council tax payments for second homes from the 2017-18 financial year. But self-catering units are classed as businesses and so their owners pay business tax to the Treasury rather than council tax. According to the law, self-catering units have to be made available for letting for 140 days a year, and owners have to prove they have been let for at least 70 days. Mr Humphreys, chairman of the council's corporate scrutiny committee, told the Post Cyntaf programme there was no mechanism for monitoring the situation. He called for AMs and MPs to demand a law change to make it compulsory for anyone seeking to reclassify their holiday home as a self-catering unit to apply for planning permission. But Peredur Jenkins, cabinet member responsible for resources, said the council had no power to stop owners from designating their properties as self-catering units. The council previously warned the potential ""loophole"" could leave authorities worse off. Mr Jenkins said Gwynedd was pressing the Welsh Government to consider changing the planning regulations to give local authorities the power to determine whether owners could re-classify their properties. The Welsh Conservatives have criticised the second home tax as an unfair ""money-spinner"", with shadow local government minister Janet Finch-Saunders calling it a ""spiteful wealth tax"". She said it was a ""a direct tax on people with second homes, many of whom already pay twice for services they rarely use"". An estimated 23,000 homes in Wales are empty or used as second homes.","Owners of holiday homes could avoid paying council tax by reclassifying them as self-catering units, a councillor has warned.",[],[],0

"Tips on how to push students to sign up for expensive courses were included in records released during a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Mr Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has denied that the school misled students. But Hillary Clinton described the venture as a ""fraudulent scheme"". Mrs Clinton, who leads to race to be the Democratic nominee, said the former school was ""used to prey upon those who could least afford it"". The now defunct for profit school is at the centre of two class-action lawsuits in San Diego, California, alleging the company scammed students by failing to deliver on promises to impart Mr Trump's secrets of real estate success. Former students say they were misled by adverts claiming Mr Trump had ""hand-picked"" teachers and ""overseen"" the curriculum. The billionaire businessman continues to maintain the majority of his customers were satisfied with the real estate programme. The documents were released following an order by US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel. The judge ruled that the files were in the public interest since Mr Trump had become ""the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race"". Trump University was launched in 2004 as a business venture under the Trump brand, offering courses in entrepreneurship. The extent of Mr Trump's involvement in the scheme is a key point on contention. The trove of documents include manuals or ""playbooks"" for employees outlining how to ""close the deal"" and convince students to invest in business seminars that cost up to nearly $35,000 (Â£24,288). The ""playbooks"" also advised sales staff on how to speak to reporters, how to dress and run Trump University events, as well as how to identify students with the most liquid assets. The unsealed files also included depositions from executives describing how the operation worked. They also included statements from employees describing the program a ""scam"". Former staff member Ronald Schnackenberg wrote that he left Trump University in 2007, citing the program used ""misleading, fraudulent and dishonest"" tactics. The previously unseen testimony from Trump University executives goes some way to show Mr Trump's level of involvement in the school's marketing strategy. Michael Sexton, Trump University president, said in a 2012 deposition that Mr Trump offered ""very good and substantive input"" to the program's marketing materials. The documents were released in one of two class-action lawsuits in California against Trump University. In a separate civil lawsuit in New York, Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has alleged that Trump University used deceptive practices and misled students about the support they would get. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing. A judge has said the $40m case in New York could proceed to trial, but Mr Trump has appealed the ruling. The San Diego case involving the released documents is expected to go to trial in late November, just weeks after the US presidential election. Mr Trump could be called to testify. But he is not the only presidential candidate marred by legal dispute. His Democratic opponent, Mrs Clinton, remains embroiled in an investigation over her use of private email while serving as US secretary of state.","US presidential hopeful Donald Trump was involved in the marketing of his now-defunct Trump University, court documents show.",[],[],0
"The plan to restrict the promotion of foods high in fat, salt and sugar to under 16s is being consulted on by the Committee of Advertising Practice. It would see the existing ban on TV ads extended to all media, including online outlets, the industry regulator said. Current limits on using celebrities and characters to sell food to children could be relaxed for healthier foods. About one in five children in the England is classed as obese by the end of primary school, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. The self-regulatory body, CAP, which sets rules for UK advertising, said the new rules could make a ""meaningful contribution to tackling this important health issue"". Currently, food and drink deemed unhealthy can be advertised to children in non-broadcast media, unlike television where strict regulation prohibits it through content and scheduling restrictions. Ofcom research suggests that 96% of 12 to 15-year-olds spent more time online than watching TV last year. The advertising industry needed to make sure its regulations reflected changing media habits among young people, CAP said. Evidence showed advertising had a ""modest"" effect on children's food preferences, it said. However, factors such as parental influence, opportunities for physical exercise and education playing a greater role in solutions to childhood obesity, it argued. Chairman James Best said: ""Advertising is just one small factor in a very complex equation but we believe we can play a positive part in addressing an urgent societal challenge. ""In proposing new rules, our aim is to strike the right balance between protecting children and enabling businesses to continue advertising their products responsibly."" Alex Neill, of consumer watchdog Which?, said a rule change was ""long overdue"", and vital to tackling childhood obesity. But Children's Food Campaign co-ordinator Malcolm Clark said the proposals had ""too many gaps in the detail of the consultation and scope for the rules to be weakened"". The regulator had ""missed obvious opportunities to make the UK a world leader in putting the protection of children's health above food and advertising industry profits,"" he said.

After a routine smear test, Susan was advised that she had a prolapse. This explained why she leaked urine every day. A vaginal prolapse is a condition in which structures, such as the uterus, rectum, bladder, urethra, small bowel or the vagina, itself may begin to prolapse, or fall out of their normal positions. Susan says she dreaded going out shopping and seeking the nearest public toilet when out and about became routine. ""Everyday life was impossible. At times standing became unbearable, running and playing with my daughter impossible,"" she said . According to Susan, while a consultant advised having an implant, she was never informed of the potential problems. ""I was never advised, for instance, that it was actual mesh. I wasn't given any leaflets to say of the side effects or anything like that.

In fact she left hospital in tremendous pain and said during the past 12 months she has been passed round several specialists. She said part of the problem is convincing people that there is something wrong. The 51-year-old said she has been told by specialists not to be frightened of her pain and to try to live and work through it.

"Five men were jailed in March for the £400,000 spree of raids and burglaries across the east of England. About 140 officers from Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and two other units swooped on properties linked to the men on Wednesday. It is thought the gang bought the goods with money from the robberies. Police seized an Audi A5, a pick-up truck, a caravan, quad bikes and heavy machinery including diggers from properties in Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, Potton in Bedfordshire and Upwell in Norfolk. Cannabis factories, with a combined street value between £18,000 and £54,000, were also discovered at the Potton and Upwell properties. Police said the properties were connected to Joseph Upton, John Smith and Albert Smith. Along with John Christopher Smith and Alfred Stanley, they were sentenced to 22 years for carrying out ram-raids at 12 banks in 2012 across Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. They stole more than £300,000 from cash machines and cars and jewellery more than £100,000 during burglaries. Damage caused in the ram-raids was estimated at costing about £250,000 to repair.

He had moved into the flat which came with her job as a groom at the sanctuary.

Prosecutors said the attack on Miss Davies began in the flat in Pitsea Hall Lane, then continued outside as she fled in her pyjamas. Taylor had denied initially making ""disfiguring"" cuts to Miss Davies' face and left breast as ""punishment"" for trying to end the relationship, before eventually going on to kill her. CCTV footage showed Taylor attempting to hoist Miss Davies' near-lifeless body over a hedge out of view. He was found by police crouching in bushes near her body. Miss Davies died later that night in Basildon Hospital. Taylor was charged with her murder. The jury heard Taylor, a martial arts enthusiast, had tried to control a number of aspects of Miss Davies' life. Her mother Dyanne Lambert told the court he would not allow her daughter to wear short-sleeved or low-cut tops and the couple would often argue. ""She became very quiet and didn't want to talk about what was going on,"" she said. Speaking after Taylor was sentenced, Mrs Lambert said: ""Obviously nothing will bring our Laura back but we are glad that he will be off the streets for a very long time. ""Twenty-three years is long, but it will not bring our baby back."" Miss Davies' father, John Davies, said: ""We've lost Laura forever and it's very hard to deal with. ""We thank the justice system for all their work and for the sentence, but we repeat, it still never brings our beautiful Laura back."" Judge Gratwicke told Taylor his ""wicked actions"" had ""totally devastated the family"".

"Civil Aviation Authority data suggested there were 83 incidents at the airport in 2016, up from 44 the previous year. The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said the rate of attacks was dangerously high and could soon result in a serious incident. It has called for new police powers to help prevent attacks from taking place. The rate of attacks, in relation to the number of flights taking off or landing at Glasgow Airport, was ""significantly high"". There were 98,127 flights to and from Glasgow last year compared to 474,963 at Heathrow Airport, where there were 151 laser attacks. Birmingham and Manchester also continued to experience high numbers of attacks. Incidents at Edinburgh Airport dropped from 55 to 44 from 2015 to 2016. Across the UK, 1,258 laser attacks were reported in 2016, down from 1,439 the year before, which equates to more than three incidents a day on average. Balpa flight safety specialist Steve Landells said: ""We are concerned that at more than three reports a day this figure is still dangerously high. ""We're also concerned that under-reporting of incidents could mean that we don't have a true idea of the scale of the problem."" He welcomed the new Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill, which proposes to increase the powers of the courts to allow them to impose prison sentences for laser attacks. He said: ""Balpa wants to see these people stopped before they commit this reckless act and we hope that the bill will give police and authorities the powers to ensure they don't happen in the first place."" The UK government's transport secretary Chris Grayling said shining a laser pointer at pilots was ""incredibly dangerous and could have fatal consequences"" He added: ""Whilst we know laser pens can be fun and many users have good intentions, some are not aware of the risks of dazzling drivers or pilots putting public safety at risk. ""That's why we want to take the common sense approach to strengthen our laws to protect the public from those who are unaware of the dangers or, even worse, intentionally want to cause harm. This kind of dangerous behaviour risks lives and must be stopped. ""There are around 1,500 laser attacks on aircraft every year in the UK and we know there have been similar attacks on trains and buses.

Tickets for next year's event go on sale in October, it has been confirmed.

The last fallow year was 2012. In June, Eavis had told the BBC he was ""talking to Longleat"" as it was his ""favourite site"" for a new festival. He had added that hosting it at Worthy Farm meant dealing with 22 different landowners, which ""wasn't easy"".

"Researchers from Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts found a doubling in the odds of obesity by the time the child was three years old. The team said birth by C-section might affect bacteria in the gut, which in turn affects the way food is digested. The study looked at 1,255 pairs of mothers and children from 1999 to 2002. The mothers joined the study - published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood - before 22 weeks of pregnancy. Their babies were measured and weighed at birth and this was repeated at the age of three. About one in four of the deliveries were C-section births and the remainder were vaginal deliveries. The team found a link between body mass, skin thickness and how a child was born. They also found that mothers who delivered by C-section tended to weigh more than those delivering traditionally - something which is known to influence obesity. But the researchers said another possible explanation was the difference in the composition of gut bacteria acquired at birth between the two delivery methods. They suggested expectant mothers who choose a C-section should be made aware of the obesity risk to their babies. In the UK just over 23% of births are Caesarean. Patrick O'Brien, a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ""This is an interesting study, but small. It needs to be replicated in a bigger sample.""","Babies born by Caesarean section are more likely to be obese, a study suggests.",[],[],0

"A pregnant traveller, 18, said she was put in a ward on her own and not allowed visitors, as ""she was a Gypsy"". It was one account uncovered in a study into Gypsy and travellers' experiences of the Welsh NHS. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said there were ""real challenges"" and more needed to be done. Chairwoman of the assembly's Gypsy and Traveller Committee Labour AM Julie Morgan said the discrimination was an ""absolute disgrace"". According to the last official count over 900 Gypsy and traveller families live in caravans across Wales, with 35% living on sites in Cardiff and Pembrokeshire alone. In what is thought to be the first survey of its kind in Europe, about 100 Gypsies and travellers were interviewed by community champions as part of the study, between April 2016 and March 2017. Travellers spoke of difficulties accessing GP services, claiming they faced discrimination from receptionists and barriers filling in registration forms as many are illiterate. A distrust of dentists also led to children saying they had needed to have between 10 and 20 rotten teeth removed. Report author Dr Adrian Marsh said while some GPs gave travellers prescriptions for during the summer period, when they travel to festivals and cultural events, others did not. He said large numbers of visitors descending on hospital wards during visiting hours often created tensions and lead to conflict. Some evidence of good practice especially in north Wales were also highlighted in the report. Speaking at the report's launch at the Pierhead in Cardiff Mrs Morgan said the experiences of the community were often ""very negative"" and people were nervous of seeking help. She said she hoped the report could be a blueprint for improving services for a community which was ""one of the most stigmatised"" in Wales. ""It's very shocking to hear some of the ways people have been treated in the health service,"" she said. ""There have been very good examples, very good relationships with district nurses, with GPs, but also a lot of stories of discrimination; difficulties getting access to the health service, ways people had been treated, stigma, and this really illustrates it, and it is really something we have got to tackle."" Mr Gething said the Welsh Government was working in partnership with health boards to improve access to NHS services for communities.

This young man is reported to be a student at Wuhan University and was said to be studying for exams when water started coming into his room. He then simply moved to squat on top of his chair as it continued to rise. Reports say he later left the room in search of higher ground when water levels reached the height of his desk, returning only when the water had receded.

"Mr Jammeh has denied similar allegations in the past. He will be seeking re-election for a fifth term and for the first time he will be facing a single major opposition candidate. HRW urges external pressure on The Gambia to prevent further violence. In a report published on Wednesday, the group says two Gambian activists have died in custody, with dozens of critics of President Jammeh in jail. They are being denied medical or legal help, the report says. The Gambia, a popular tourist destination because of its beaches, has never experienced a democratic transition of power since independence. Mr Jammeh took over in a 1994 coup. His critics accuse him of running a repressive state, an allegation he denies.

Mr Barrow's nomination is the result of the biggest opposition alliance in Gambia since independence, the AFP news agency reported.

"Dr Balshaw will become the first female director in the Tate's 120-year history and will replace Sir Nicholas Serota, who has been at the helm since 1988. She will take charge of the Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London as well as offshoots in Liverpool and St Ives. Under her stewardship, the Whitworth had an award-winning expansion in 2015. She also runs Manchester Art Gallery. Dr Balshaw said she will focus on developing the organisation's reputation as ""artistically adventurous"". She added: ""I am tremendously excited to be leading Tate in the next chapter of its life. I look forward to developing Tate's reputation as the most artistically adventurous and culturally inclusive gallery in the world."" Balshaw, whose appointment was approved by Prime Minister Theresa May, is the gallery's ninth director and will take up her new post on 1 June. Lord Browne, chairman of the trustees of Tate, said: ""The Trustees and I know that Maria has the vision, drive and stature to lead Tate into its next phase of development. We enthusiastically look forward to working with her as she does so."" An ambitious, charismatic and indefatigable operator who is admired by artists and administrators alike, Dr Balshaw has been one of the key movers in Manchester's cultural renaissance over the past decade. She took over the Whitworth in 2006 then took on the main civic gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, in 2011. They have been good training for Tate - you could say the contemporary Whitworth is the Tate Modern of Manchester, while the more traditional Manchester Art Gallery is the equivalent of Tate Britain. She has been Manchester City Council's cultural leader, is on the Arts Council England board and was made a CBE in 2015. She proved her vision and leadership with the Â£15m redevelopment of the Whitworth, which was named museum of the year by The Art Fund in 2015. She also helped persuade then Chancellor George Osborne to include a Â£110m arts venue, The Factory, in his Northern Powerhouse plans. But she is equally at home with the world's leading artists - she has forged strong relationships with the likes of Gerhard Richter, Marina Abramovic and Cornelia Parker. Her Whitworth exhibitions have shown a passion for work from all corners of the globe, from the excellent current Warhol show to the art of her beloved West Africa, and work that brings her rooms to life - stimulating, not static. Which sums her up pretty well. She has big shoes to fill. During his 29 years in charge, Sir Nicholas has built up the Tate to be one of the world's most successful art brands. Tate Modern alone gets 4.5 million visitors per year and has just opened a Â£260m new extension. Tate St Ives is currently closed for renovation and will reopen in March. When he announced his departure, Sir Nicholas set a challenge to his successor, saying Tate still has ""the potential to reach broad audiences across the UK and abroad, through its own programmes, partnerships and online"". Sir Nicholas will now become chairman of Arts Council England. Maria Balshaw's appointment as director of the Tate sees her join a growing number of women in top jobs in the UK arts establishment. They include Frances Morris, who became Tate Modern's director last year, Jude Kelly, artistic director of London's Southbank Centre and Tamara Rojo, artistic director as well as principal lead dancer at English National Ballet. Vicky Featherstone and Josie Rourke head up London's Royal Court and Donmar Warehouse theatres, while Erica Whyman is deputy artistic director of the RSC and Cressida Pollock has been the ENO's chief executive officer since 2015. In the world of film, a pair of Amandas - Berry and Nevill - hold the chief executive positions at Bafta and the BFI respectively.

"The review panel says WHO was too slow to act to get on top of the deadly virus which has now killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa. And it calls for an urgent overhaul of the organisation. WHO says it has plans for reform. It has already admitted that it waited too long to declare Ebola a public health emergency of international concern. WHO Director General, Margaret Chan, admitted in May it had been ""overwhelmed"" by the Ebola outbreak, saying it ""shook this organization to its core"". The disease began spreading in December 2013, but it took until August 2014 for WHO to sound the alarm. By that point, more than 1,000 people had died of the virus. The death toll now stands at more than 11,000. According to the report, WHO lacked a culture of rapid decision-making. In the early stages of the Ebola crisis, messages were sent about the seriousness of the situation but these ""either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their significance"". ""There seems to have been a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy rather than by scaling up emergency action,"" the report says. WHO was also criticised for failing to keep governments and the public up to speed about the extent and severity of the outbreak. But the review praised WHO for playing a critical role in pushing forward work to find new treatments and cures for Ebola. And it said WHO should be given the job of leading future health emergency responses - be that for Ebola or an outbreak of pandemic flu, for example. The report suggests an immediate contribution from all member countries towards a $100 million special outbreak response fund, and says WHO should establish a Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response. The panel's head, Dame Barbara Stocking, former chief executive of the charity Oxfam, said the WHO must now be made fit for the task. ""To me, coming from somewhere like Oxfam which is an emergency culture, you are very much, if you like, on the front foot. You are always trying to prevent a situation coming through or grab it when it starts and really get it under control very fast and those are some of the internal changes that have to be made at WHO."" The WHO said it was ""already moving forward"" on some of the panel's recommendations including the development of the global health emergency workforce and the contingency fund. It will be up to member states to make these voluntary financial contributions. Dr Joanne Liu, President of MSF International, questioned how the recommendations would translate to real action on the ground. ""We have seen so many reports calling for change, with everyone focused on how to improve future response and meanwhile, with 20-25 new Ebola cases per week in the region, we still don`t have the current epidemic under control. On Ebola, we went from global indifference, to global fear, to global response and now to global fatigue. We must finish the job,"" she said. Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said the support of the global community was crucial if we are to avert another catastrophe on the scale of Ebola.""",The World Health Organization (WHO) has been criticised in a report for its handling of the Ebola outbreak.,[],[],0

"She told her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party in Berlin she expected her toughest campaign yet and would ""fight for our values and our way of life"". An election is due to be held next year after four years of coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD). Mrs Merkel's poll ratings have slipped since the height of her popularity but she retains wide support. The chancellor, who has been in office since 2005, is also being challenged by the populist right-wing AfD party. She announced she would stand again after meeting party leaders at CDU headquarters. She told reporters that the decision to run for a fourth term had been ""anything but trivial after 11 years in office"". She added that she expected challenges from both the right and the left of the political spectrum. Is Merkel really on the ropes? Profile: Angela Merkel . In September, Mrs Merkel accepted responsibility for election defeats for the CDU in several states and conceded that her open-door policy towards migrants was a factor. Germany expected up to 300,000 migrants to arrive in the country this year, the head of the country's federal office for migration and refugees said earlier this year. In 2015, Germany received more than a million applications for asylum. She's kept Germany guessing for weeks, but it looks as though Angela Merkel has finally answered the so called K-frage (chancellor question). A poll for one Sunday newspaper (in German) found that 55% of Germans would vote for her. Mrs Merkel's approval ratings have gone up and down in recent months as a result of her refugee policy but they remain the envy of other world leaders. Even so, she will be battling the tide of populism that swept Donald Trump to victory in the States and which is also washing across Europe. The anti-Muslim party Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) is likely to win seats in the national parliament next year. It's highly unlikely to take Mrs Merkel down but it is leaching votes from Germany's established political parties. Those parties are - by and large - likely to be relieved by Mrs Merkel's decision. In the past few years the job of German chancellor has become one of the most powerful political positions in the world. The next incumbent must not only lead the country but deal with a fragmenting EU, in a world which may be much changed by the new US administration. It's widely (sometimes grudgingly ) accepted here that there simply isn't another realistic candidate for the job. As one broadcaster put it: ""Angela Merkel - the indispensable"".

"The list of MPs who will chair Labour policy committees reads like a who's who of Mr Corbyn's internal critics. They include pro-Trident MP John Woodcock who reportedly turned the air blue at a Blairite event as he summed up his views on Mr Corbyn's leadership. The annual Parliamentary party departmental committee elections normally pass without controversy. But this year there appears to have been a concerted effort by Corbyn-sceptic MPs to gain control of one of the party's policy making mechanisms, according to grassroots website Labour List. Particularly as only four of the 17 posts were contested - although that may be because most of Corbyn's Labour allies already have roles as shadow ministers. Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, who has said Mr Corbyn's economic policy would result in ""higher inflation and higher cost of living"" which would hit ""the very people we should be standing up for"", will chair the Parliamentary Party's Treasury committee. Ian Austin, who tweeted ""I'm getting a little tired of the self-indulgent comfort-zone fantasy that Corbyn could ever persuade mainstream voters to make him PM,"" will chair the party's education committee. Shabana Mahmood, who quit the shadow cabinet, because she ""strongly disagreed"" with Mr Corbyn's economic policies, will chair the justice committee. Other Corbyn critics to be appointed to committee chairs include Caroline Flint, Tristram Hunt, Ivan Lewis, Mike Gapes and Emma Reynolds. They will have the power to stand in for shadow ministers at the despatch box, although this is rarely used, and influence policy decisions behind the scenes. Who chairs Labour backbench committees doesn't usually make the headlines - but then there has rarely been such a gulf between a leader and many of his own MPs. The lack of support for Jeremy Corbyn at Westminster was underlined by the fact that all but two of the successful candidates backed either Liz Kendall or Yvette Cooper for leader - and none backed him. Mr Corbyn had said he wanted these positions to become more influential - and that is exactly the intention of the new chairmen and women, too. Nine of them will serve on Labour's National Policy Forum. John Woodcock - who is now the Parliamentary Labour Party's defence chairman - said he will remind his leadership that MPs were elected on a policy of retaining the nuclear deterrent. And the new Treasury chairman Chris Leslie has denounced both his leader - and the shadow chancellor's - economic policies. Mr Corbyn is at odds with his many of his centre-left MPs in key policy areas, including the renewal of Trident, the welfare cap and military action in Syria. But he has vowed to open up the party's policy making process to its members, the vast majority of whom voted for him to be leader. This has sparked fears among ""moderate"" MPs that their views will be sidelined. ""Many MPs feel the agenda of many of Corbyn's backers is less about Jeremy, more about a left realignment of the party,"" writes an anonymous columnist on Blairite website Progress. ""This would be achieved with manifestos decided by conferences and executive meetings, with MPs restrained by fear of reselection. Once such changes are achieved, any leader will have to follow.""",Jeremy Corbyn is facing a revolt from some of his own MPs.,[],"['The summary states that Jeremy Corbyn is facing a revolt, but the text does not mention a ""revolt"" or any organized rebellion against him.

"The Victorian-era vessel became part of nautical folklore after it vanished in the mid-19th Century. Its captain, Sir John Franklin, had been searching for the fabled Northwest Passage. Experts on Thursday confirmed that the wreck, discovered last month, was indeed the celebrated Royal Navy vessel. ""It is in astonishing condition,'' said search team member John Geiger, president of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. ""We're over the moon."" The ship set sail from England in 1845 under Sir John's command. He was accompanied by a second ship, HMS Terror, captained by Francis Crozier. Alongside Sir John were 128 officers, all of them aiming to find the elusive sea route linking the Atlantic to the Pacific via the Arctic seas off northern Canada. The two vessels were last seen in the summer of that year bypassing whaling boats in Baffin Bay, off the coast of Greenland. But soon afterwards, the ships vanished. Inuit hunters told tales of starving white men who had been seen in the freezing wilderness over the following months and years. Historians speculated that the ships had become trapped in the vast ice floes of the Canadian Arctic. But until Thursday the exact fate of HMS Erebus had not been known. The ship was discovered after the Canadian government ploughed millions of pounds into an extensive search operation. It was found under just 11 metres of water near King William Island, 2,000km (1,200 miles) north-west of Toronto. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper even participated in the search himself, such was his determination to resolve the mystery. HMS Terror has still not been discovered. Canada has been attempting to assert sovereignty over the Northwest Passage in recent years, claiming the area as its own. However the US government and others say it is international territory.",The wreck of HMS Erebus has been found off the coast of Canada.,"['The summary states that the wreck of HMS Erebus was found off the coast of Canada, but the source text specifies it was found near King William Island,  2000 km from Toronto.

Unable to afford the training costs on his own, he decided to offer 50% of the ownership to people he knew through his local pub, the Cresselly Arms at Cresswell Quay. The syndicate grew to 17 members but none except Mr Cole had owned a racehorse before. They said they were amazed when Tobefair started winning races and never dreamed he would make it to Cheltenham. The festival runs from Tuesday to Friday and culminates in the showpiece contest, the Gold Cup. Mr Cole said: ""There's a lot of these big people now, they've got 40, 50, 60 horses, and it doesn't mean anything. But it means something to us."" Syndicate member Andy Pannell described the experience as ""total exhilaration"", adding: ""We were stood on the steps at Newbury and I thought I was going to have a heart attack. My heart was pounding, thumping."" This is also a first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival for Tobefair's trainers Debra and Paul Hamer's, whose yard is at Nantycaws near Carmarthen.

"Our first job was to go to the editorial planning meeting to find out how the BBC team decide what news stories to cover. We created our own running order for the programme and had a debate about what topics should go on air. We wanted to cover education in different countries, pollution and child abuse. Then we compared our running order with the actual one for the Radio 4 show. We only had two similarities - a story about the Queen's opinion on the EU and how much we pay for our energy bills. While presenter Mr Mardell and the team prepared for the lunchtime show we went for some smartphone training. It was really interesting and helpful because it taught us how to make professional videos and photos. Top tips included how to film a five-shot sequence, with each part lasting eight seconds. With it getting closer to one o'clock, we went to listen to World at One being broadcast live in the studio. We watched from the editorial room where they were taking live calls. It was really interesting, but we knew what was going to happen beforehand because we'd been in the planning meeting! When Mr Mardell came off air we were able to interview him, and we joined him in the studio to ask him some questions. We asked him what he most liked about presenting World at One and how he got his job as a journalist. He told us his favourite part of the job is meeting lots of new people and persuading them to give their real opinions on air. He explained that he became a journalist by following his talents and started doing journalism at university. Then we asked him what his most awkward moment was. He said he hasn't had any but that he is always worried that he won't be handed the script by his producers on time and that he is scared he might say something wrong.

"Despite returning 80 more councillors, 184 in total, at Thursday's local elections in Wales, the party only took control of Monmouthshire. Welsh Tory chairman Jonathan Evans said June's poll will be regarded as a Theresa May-Jeremy Corbyn battle. Welsh Labour's Chris Evans said the local election results gave the party a ""firm foundation"" to build on. Although Labour lost more than 100 councillors in Wales, taking its tally down to 472, and lost control of both Bridgend and Blaenau Gwent councils, the results were not as bad for the party as had been predicted. Labour was also three seats short of a majority in Merthyr Tydfil, but polling has been delayed until next month in the Cyfarthfa ward following the death of a candidate. It means a five-week wait before the council's final political makeup is clear. The ward elected two independents and one Labour councillor in 2012. Ex-MP and general election candidate in June Chris Evans said: ""What's quite clear is Labour in Wales is much stronger than the polls are telling us at the moment. ""People haven't deserted the Labour Party - people still have faith and they're still strong with the Labour Party and that is what we will build on in the next four weeks."" Jonathan Evans, who is running the Conservative general election campaign in Wales, told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme there had been a range of alternatives to Labour in Welsh elections. But he said: ""In the general election it's my expectation that people will see this as a two party contest. ""The election has been presented as a choice between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May. ""I see it that way, and the public see it that way as well and I think that is going to be very helpful for the Conservative Party in these elections."" Plaid Cymru said gaining more than 30 councillors, meaning the party now has 202, was ""great news"". It said voting patterns in some local election areas were a cause for optimism ahead of the general election. Ynys Mon AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said it was ""pleasing"" to see gains ""in places where we aren't seen as traditionally strong"". ""Looking across the board it's got to be seen I think as a pretty solid result for Plaid Cymru and bodes well for the poll which is coming up in just a few weeks' time."" The Liberal Democrats lost 11 council seats and now have 62 councillors in Wales in what Lib Dem AM and Welsh Government Education Secretary Kirsty Williams called ""a mixed set of results"". But she said local election voting should not be seen as a prediction of what will happen on 8 June. ""I think we have to be very careful not to make a direct read across from local government elections to the general election,"" she said. ""What's absolutely clear is that politics is in a state of flux and there are arguments to be made on doorsteps in the weeks to come.""

"Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran has written to the UK government offering support for early legislation. The Scottish government has already called for action before Westminster breaks for the general election. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael has said officials are looking at the options. These are likely to include a section 30 order which is much less complicated than an act of parliament. In a letter to the Scottish secretary, Ms Curran said: ""I am writing to offer our support for a Section 30 order to devolve the franchise to the Scottish Parliament immediately if it is brought forward by the government. ""This will ensure that there is enough time for the Scottish Parliament to make the changes necessary to ensure 16 and 17-year-olds are able to vote in 2016."" The Smith Commission on further devolution called for the UK to ""devolve the relevant powers in sufficient time"" for that election. Its recommendations were agreed by all five political parties in the Scottish Parliament. The independence referendum was the first national vote in which 16 and 17-year-olds were able to take part. The chief counting officer for the referendum, Mary Pitcaithly, chairs the board that oversees election management in Scotland. She said: ""If changes of this significance are going to be made, the earlier that election professionals know about this the better, so that appropriate preparations can be made to minimise any risks"". Mr Carmichael discussed the issue with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week. Ahead of that meeting he said he saw ""no reason"" why votes at 16 could not be in place for the 2016 vote. Labour also wants him to consider which other powers might be suitable for fast-track devolution. Ms Curran said: ""Many of the Smith Commission proposals will require primary legislation, and Labour will introduce a Scotland Act in our first Queen's Speech. ""However, it is right that we should assess which powers could be passed more quickly and where the Labour Party could offer its support."" The Scottish government has specifically called for early control of air passenger duty and disability living allowance. But the Scottish secretary has described votes at 16 as an ""exception"" to the general principle that further devolution ""will proceed as a package"". Mr Carmichael was asked about when tax powers would be devolved at a Holyrood committee last week. He said: ""With the budgetary consequences that come with that, there is probably a greater interest in ensuring that you get the whole thing as a package rather than taking it in dribs and drabs.""",Labour has called on the UK government to devolve voting rights for 16 and 17-year-olds immediately.,[],[],0
