"The report for 2015 is due out in the next few weeks, so the most recent report we have is the 2014 one. In the year covered by that report, 1,013 tests were conducted for IPC sports (which include athletics, swimming, powerlifting and skiing) in which prohibited substances were found nine times. During the year, sanctions were taken against 11 athletes. If you break that down into the sports involved it is clear that most of the IPC's anti-doping problems come from the sport of powerlifting, which was the source of seven of the positive tests and eight of the sanctions. The IPC announced in 2014 that it had suspended 13 powerlifters in the previous 14 months. The sport has been targeted with a ""Raise the Bar - Say No! to Doping"" campaign. Since then, the IPC has also adopted a new anti-doping code, which came into effect on 1 January 2015. Paralympic athletes have the same list of banned substances as Olympic athletes and, like them, anyone who requires additional medication for pain or treatment must apply for an exemption. ""It's a common misconception that a lot of Paralympians will be on prescription drugs. That's not the case at all,"" Nicole Sapstead, UK Anti-Doping chief executive, told the BBC ahead of London 2012. ""Obviously there are athletes with spinal injuries and they need pain relief. But mostly it is the same as the Olympics - things like asthma and diabetes."" Only one athlete was given a doping sanction at the Sochi Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, but since then the McLaren Report for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia's sports ministry manipulated urine samples provided by its athletes between 2011 and 2015. The report identified 27 samples relating to eight Para-sports, five of which are summer sports, including some governed by the IPC. The IPC also found evidence that samples were swapped during the Sochi Winter Paralympics, adding that it planned to reanalyse every Russian sample given at the event. So now the Russian team has been banned from this year's Paralympic Games in Rio, and the IPC is wondering if it has more of a doping problem than it previously thought.",Every four years the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) releases its annual anti-doping report.,"['The summary makes up the full name of the IPC', ""The summary makes up that there's 4 years between reports"", 'The summary states that the IPC releases an annual anti-doping report, but the text does not explicitly state that the report is specifically an ""anti-doping"" report.

"It is the last day of the Indian prime minister's tour of China and he is meeting some of the heads of Chinese industry. He will be hoping that they will be able to drive forward his signature policy, 'Make in India'. But one year into his term as prime minister and many say Mr Modi is showing some distinctly undemocratic tendencies as he tries to foster a manufacturing boom in India. At the end of April, India cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded non-governmental organisations (NGOs), saying they didn't comply with the country's tax codes. And the Indian government has singled out the environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, for special attention. The reason why says a lot, both about Mr Modi's ambitions for India and his attitude to dissent. This week Greenpeace won a small victory. On Wednesday the government lifted its ban on activist Priya Pillai travelling abroad. In January she was stopped from travelling to the UK to testify to British MPs about the effects of coal mining in India. But the war is far from over. The charity says it will have to close down in a matter of weeks unless the Indian government lifts the financial freeze it has imposed on the NGO. A secret report from India's Intelligence Bureau, leaked last year, explains why India's government has such a beef with the environmental charity. It said campaigns headed by Greenpeace and other NGOs had drained three percentage points off the nation's annual growth rate. Greenpeace wouldn't claim to have been anywhere near that influential but its campaign against the coal industry does strike at the heart of the 'Make in India' policy. Coal is the main source of power in India and is central to the BJP government's plans to boost industrial production. It is also the most polluting of all fossil fuels and a key driver of climate change. And, when it comes to coal, India compares poorly even with China, as Mr Modi's visit highlights. China's coal use of coal has been falling steeply, helping stall world growth in CO2 emissions. Meanwhile India's CO2 emissions are forecast to rise rapidly. According to the International Energy Agency, India is set to double its coal consumption by 2035 and become the world's largest coal importer by around 2020. Almost half of the 1,200 new coal-fired power stations proposed around the world are in India according to the World Resources Institute. That's why campaigning against the coal industry in India has been a priority for Greenpeace. The charity's campaigns have stopped coal mining in some of India's forest areas. The NGO will also have earned the government's ire by its relentless attack on two of India's corporate behemoths, Coal India and the Adani Group. Coal India is the biggest coal company in the world and India's fifth largest company. The Adani Group is the third biggest coal company in world and its head, Gautam Adani, is known to be close to the Indian prime minister. But the Indian government's attempt to muzzle Greenpeace and other NGOs has generated a chorus of criticism. India likes to celebrate its status as the world's largest democracy but the American ambassador to India has said its harassment of NGOs had a ""chilling effect"" on the nation's democracy. When the Indian electorate voted Mr Modi into power with a handsome majority a year ago they were voting for his promise to transform the Indian economy. Mr Modi is clearly determined to deliver on that promise. Indeed some Indians now fear that he may compromise some of the country's other core values along the way.",Narendra Modi is sitting down with a group of Chinese business leaders in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.,"[""The summary mentions Prime Minister Modi's first name is Narendra, which is true, but the source text doesn't mention the Prime Minister's first name."", ""The summary mentions that the Prime Minister will meet with Chinese leaders in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.

"The FTSE 100 index closed 2.27% higher, while the FTSE 250 closed up 1.68%. The pound fell 1.2% against the dollar to $1.3264 after Mr Carney said a deteriorating outlook meant action from the Bank was likely during the summer. Shares in the US rose, with both the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index up by 0.6% in morning trading. The past few days have seen huge swings on the world's financial markets as traders and investors struggled to assess the impact of the UK's vote to leave the European Union. After two days of heavy falls following the vote, shares spent two days recovering, and on Wednesday, the FTSE 100 ended above the level it had closed at last Thursday. However, the FTSE 250 index - which contains more UK-focused companies - still remains well below its pre-referendum level. ""The blue chip [FTSE 100] index is stuffed full with big international firms and it is these companies propelling the rise. The heavy weighting towards these groups is very misleading,"" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. ""The likes of Fresnillo, Randgold, AstraZeneca, Royal Dutch Shell, British American Tobacco - these are hardly dependent on, or reflective of, the UK economy. They're listed in London but their earnings come from abroad. ""There is a key distinction. UK-focused firms are doing much, much worse.

As well as falling against the dollar after Mr Carney's speech, it also tumbled 1.1% against the euro at â‚¬1.1962. Analysts continued to warn that the recent market recovery might only be temporary. ""The odds may be against them, but investors are hoping that the worst is over for currencies and equities,"" Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said in a note. ""But considering there's been no additional clarity on the terms of Brexit or the outlook for the UK economy and global economy since Britain's decision to leave the European Union on Friday, we don't see fundamental support for the recent moves.""

"Mr Green was charged after arriving at Livingston police station. Mr Whyte later attended a police station in Glasgow and was detained in custody. A third man, former Rangers co-administrator David Whitehouse, was earlier arrested in England. All three men are expected to appear at Glasgow Sherriff Court on Wednesday. Craig Whyte, 44, took over Rangers in May 2011. The club entered administration the following year. Charles Green led the consortium which bought Rangers assets in 2012 following the club's liquidation. But he stepped down from Rangers a year later following allegations that he was working in conjunction with Craig Whyte.

"One officer was killed and 10 people injured as police and occupiers confronted each other. Locals occupied the mine and refused to leave until the miners paid them a ""tribute"". They allege that the mine lies on their ancestral lands and they should be compensated by those exploiting it. There are conflicting reports as to how police Sergeant Jose Luis Quispe died. A lawyer for the miners said he was pushed over a precipice by the squatters. But one of the squatters said the officer fell as he was fleeing the clashes. Other witnesses said Sgt Quispe lost his balance after the protesters threw an explosive device in his direction. Interior Minister Carlos Romero said his death would be investigated and those responsible would be punished harshly. One of the occupiers told local radio that the violence was triggered when more than 200 officers were sent to evict them. He warned that if the officers were not recalled, locals would block roads. He said that the miners had tried to convince locals of the benefits their work would bring to the community. But he insisted that locals wanted compensation from the mining co-operative.

""I was watching something on the TV a couple of weeks ago about the legacy of the World Cup and when us going out came up, it just brought back horrible memories. It was bitterly disappointing."" Hogg is set to be included in a squad missing the injured Harlequins wing Tim Visser - ruled out of at least the first two games - and flanker Alasdair Strokosch, who retired from Test rugby after the World Cup. Another injury concern is Glasgow centre Mark Bennett, who was due to see a specialist on Monday to determine whether he needs an operation on his injured shoulder. The involvement of Warriors pair Ryan Wilson and Tim Swinson could hinge on the outcome of disciplinary proceedings against them following the European Champions Cup loss at Northampton. But club-mate and fellow midfielder Alex Dunbar could return to the Scotland fold after missing the World Cup with the after-effects of a knee injury sustained in training during last year's Six Nations. After the Calcutta Cup opener against England at Murrayfield on 6 February, Scotland travel to Cardiff - one of three away fixtures in this year's campaign - to face Wales in their second match a week later. Hogg says the squad will be desperate to banish the memories of not only their World Cup despair, but the embarrassment of a Six Nations whitewash last year. ""It is another challenge for us now, but we can take immense confidence from the World Cup,"" said the 23-year-old, who has only tasted victory in three of his 19 Six Nations matches since his 2012 debut. ""If I'm fortunate enough to be picked, hopefully we can produce something special in this Six Nations. England first up at Murrayfield is exactly what you want and it would be great to be part of that. ""Getting a good couple of wins early doors would give us immense confidence going forward, and we'd be in the tournament if that happens. ""We have let ourselves down in the last couple of Six Nations but we are looking forward to it."" Hogg and his Glasgow team-mates will be hoping that joining up with Scotland provides a catalyst for rediscovering their World Cup form. Four successive defeats since Christmas have seen them slip to eighth in the Pro 12 table and effectively exit the European Champions Cup, after a third pool defeat on Sunday to Northampton. ""Our target was to become the number one team in Europe and we've fallen short again,"" Hogg noted. ""It's fine and well having good performances here and there but it's wins that we need.

Zverev has been widely tipped as the teenager most likely to make the breakthrough among the game's elite and he went agonisingly close to a landmark win over Nadal. The 6ft 6in German, the younger brother of tour player Mischa Zverev, led 5-3 and 40-30 in the final set, only to make three straight unforced errors. Nadal, 29, battled back impressively, but had glowing praise for the teenager, who is set to rise to a career-high ranking of 52 next week. ""He is amazingly talented,"" said Nadal. ""He is probably going to be the number one in the world. ""With his second serve at 120mph, with a lot of spin and at 124, 123, 120mph, it was impossible.

"Mustafa Bashir, 34, also forced bleach into her mouth, but the judge in Manchester said his sentence took into account his wife was not ""vulnerable"". Both Jess Phillips, Labour, and Maria Miller, Conservative, said they were concerned by the case and would write to the attorney general. Bashir's ex-wife said she was ""disappointed"" by the judge's comments. At Manchester Crown Court, Bashir of Hebers Court, Middleton, Manchester, admitted two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Judge Richard Mansell said his decision on the sentence was guided by the fact he was ""not convinced [Bashir's then wife] was a vulnerable person"" as she was ""an intelligent woman with a network of friends"" and a degree. Despite acknowledging the attacks had an ""ongoing effect"" on his victim's ability to trust people, he sentenced Bashir, who played cricket for Oldham, to 18 months, suspended for two years. Speaking to the BBC, which has agreed not to use her name, Bashir's ex-wife said she was ""disappointed in the comments which the judge made about my vulnerability"". She added: ""I am a confident and strong woman because of what I have suffered. I was suffering for my life but the judge didn't believe me."" The judge also ordered Bashir to attend a workshop entitled ''building better relationships'', pay Â£1,000 costs and banned him from contacting his ex-wife indefinitely.

"The Information Commissioner is to be asked to overrule a decision by the National Archives to keep the documents about the trial of Stephen Ward hidden. The submission is being made by lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC. It is believed Ward killed himself as his trial for living off immoral earnings was ending. Ward, an artist and osteopath living in London, had in 1961 introduced 21-year-old reputed call girl Christine Keeler to the Secretary of State for War, John Profumo. The minister and Ms Keeler - who is also thought to have had relations with an attache at the Russian embassy, Yevgeny Ivanov - started an affair. When challenged, Profumo initially denied the relationship - but was later forced to admit that he had lied in March 1963, in a scandal that threatened to topple the Conservative government of the time. Ward, who many believe was a victim of a cover-up, is understood to have killed himself on the last day of his trial at the Old Bailey, where he was found guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Ms Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies, who were referred to at the time of the court case as prostitutes. Mr Robertson, the author of Stephen Ward was Innocent, OK, said that he was making the appeal because keeping documents about Ward's trial hidden ""was irrational and ignores the public interest and the interests of history in discovering the truth about Ward's conviction, which is widely viewed as a miscarriage of justice"". He added: ""Releasing the official trial transcript is important to work out why Ward was ever prosecuted, and it will assist the case for overturning his conviction."" The National Archives refused Mr Robertson access to most of its file on Ward, which is believed to include the police statements used to charge him with living off the earnings of Ms Keeler and Ms Rice-Davies. Mr Robertson argues in his book that neither woman was a prostitute, and both in fact lived off Ward's earnings as a celebrated osteopath and portrait artist. The file on Ward is currently closed from public view until 2046, because this is 100 years after the birth of Ms Rice-Davies, the youngest of the trial witnesses. The Information Commissioner is set to make a decision to see if it can be opened earlier. According to Mr Robertson, this ""will cast an important new light on one of the worst miscarriages of justice in modern British history, and help explain how Stephen Ward was made the scapegoat for the Profumo affair by prosecuting him for crimes that neither he nor anyone else ever committed"".

"Derek Mackay is meeting other finance ministers for a ""quadrilateral"" summit in Edinburgh. He said he would raise ""unnecessary"" tax burdens with the chief secretary to the treasury during the meeting. The Treasury said Scottish ministers had been advised of the tax situation before setting up national services. Most other police and fire services in the UK are regional bodies and do not have to pay VAT. The issue arose because Scotland's policing and fire services were previously controlled by local councils, which can claim back the tax - but the new national forces set up in 2013 are controlled by the Scottish government, which cannot. Mr Mackay said the police and fire services were struggling with the ""unnecessary"" burden of tax which they ""simple should not have to pay"". He said: ""This is a significant sum which other emergency services do not have to meet. ""There is a significant difference in the way VAT affects emergency services across the UK, with Scottish police and fire services paying VAT when other territorial services in the UK do not have to.

Given the forecast for rain on the final day, the decision not to put Essex back in to bat again was surprising.

After dismissing former England captain Alastair Cook cheaply on day two, Roland-Jones took his third wicket of the match with the 14th ball of the third morning, as Ravi Bopara was caught at third slip, continuing his poor batting form this season. That brought Wheater to the crease, and alongside Lawrence the pair dragged Essex away from a disastrous reply to Middlesex's 507-7 declared, but Wheater was eventually out to a brilliant one-handed tumbling catch by Stevie Eskinazi at square leg to reduce the visitors to 253-6.

"In 1787, the 28-year-old Robert Burns was suddenly a ""celebrity"", according to Prof Nigel Leask, regius chair of English Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow. The 2nd Edinburgh edition of his poems had given him a quite a handsome pot of money and it had also made him famous, with the cream of Scottish society taking an interest in him. Prof Leask says: ""He was the lion of Scottish literature, everyone wants to meet him."" And Burns also wants to meet them, especially if they have the power to promote his work further and the cash to buy his books. ""Poets in the 18th Century depended on patronage so he tours around the gentry and nobles, really doing a bit of salesmanship,"" says Prof Leask. Throughout 1787 Burns embarked on a series of tours, firstly around the Scottish Borders and northern England and then further afield to the west Highlands taking in Inveraray, Arrochar and dinner with Glasgow tobacco merchant George Buchanan at Arden House at Bannachra near Loch Lomond. Later in the year he toured the Highlands during which time he stayed with the Duke and Duchess of Atholl at Blair Castle, dined with the Duke and Duchess of Gordon at Castle Gordon and visited historical sites such as the Culloden battlefield and Cawdor Castle, which featured in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Prof Leask says that Burns seems to have had letters of introduction from Edinburgh patrons that gained him access to the upper-echelons of Scottish nobility. ""He's not overawed by his posh surroundings,"" says Prof Leask. ""It shows his amazing social versatility. He's got an ability to move in all the circles of society. ""There is a sense of how thoroughly he was in the society and culture of the late 18th Century."" Prof Leask says: ""It slightly qualifies the image of the 'heaven-taught ploughman' who does not have formal qualifications, who is just a genius endowed by nature. ""This shows how learned he was, how much he knew."" Prof Leask says the tours of the Highlands are also important because it was a Lowlander's encounter with Gaelic culture, the Highland culture of Scotland. During his travels he composes songs like the Birks of Aberfeldy and discovers his east coast heritage, visiting relatives in Stonehaven and Laurencekirk. His father's family had a strong connection to the Jacobites in the north east. As well as mixing with the Scottish nobility there was plenty of time for the rock star antics for which Burns has become well known. Prof Leask recounts how Burns stopped for the night at Arden House near Loch Lomond. ""He has a very convivial night of dancing and drinking and seeing the sun rise over Ben Lomond,"" says Prof Leask. ""He sets off the next day and has a horse race on the road down to Dumbarton with a Highland man he calls Donald, who is riding an unharnessed horse and Burns is riding Jenny Geddes, his old mare. ""He is determined not to be overtaken so he races and has an accident. ""It's a bit like two boy-racers on the A82 nowadays."" The tour journals are included in the new ""Oxford Edition of the Works of Robert Burns: Commonplace Books, Tour Journals and Miscellaneous Prose"". Prof Leask says: ""This is the first time the tours have been edited to scholarly standards and cross-referenced with his poems, songs and letters. ""It enables the reader to get a good sense of how these tours contributed to his emergence as a major world poet.""","As the 200th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns is marked, BBC Scotland looks at his travels around Scotland in the 18th Century.","[""The source text does not mention the 200th anniversary of Robert Burns' birth"", 'The source text does not mention BBC scotland at all.']",inconsistent
"A report published by Alcohol Focus Scotland (AFS) claimed often concerns of local people were ignored by boards. It suggested more boards highlighted the economic importance of the licensed trade than the damaging consequences of alcohol. And it found more than half had extended licensing hours over the past six years. Boards must publish statements of licensing policy every three years, with the latest round to run until 2016. AFS analysed the 25 which had been published by the end of April 2014 and said some progress has been made in how they are controlling the availability of alcohol. But its chief executive, Dr Evelyn Gillan, said the licensing process was too removed from the people and neighbourhoods most affected by the boards' decisions. She said: ""Licensing boards have an important role in trying to minimise the harm that alcohol can cause because they have the power to control how much alcohol is available in their areas. ""The good news is that some boards are working well with the police and health professionals, declaring more areas of overprovision and actively seeking the views of local communities in licensing decision-making."" However, she added: ""There is a lack of transparency about how the evidence of alcohol harm presented to licensing boards by health, police, and local people has been listened to and acted upon."" The number of alcohol licences in Scotland has remained broadly static in recent years, according to government figures. In 2012/13 there were 16,237 premises licences across Scotland - 11,363 on-sales and 4,874 off-sales. That was slightly down on the previous 12 months (16,379), and on the figure for 2010/11 (16,377). Among the findings of the report were: . Ch Supt Mark Williams, police commander in Edinburgh said: ""My staff and other public agencies have made strong representation to the licensing authority highlighting the very clear link between the availability of alcohol and increased harm. ""In a policing context this usually manifests as anti-social behaviour, disorder and violence."" AFS said there was some good practice where boards had taken into account the views of police, health professionals and local community groups. They included in Glasgow, North Ayrshire, Aberdeen, Dumfries and Galloway, Highland and East Lothian. Fiona Moss, head of health improvement at Glasgow City Community Health Partnership said: ""We were invited to give evidence during the consultation process and I was pleased with the way the licensing board considered this evidence and listened to the principal health messages. ""I welcomed the board's decision not to further extend routine licensing hours and not to grant further breakfast licences within the new policy."" The AFS report recommended boards should produce detailed statistics to enable effective monitoring of the licensing system.","There is a ""lack of transparency"" in how Scotland's 25 licensing boards deal with alcohol, according to a charity.","[""The source text doesn't state AFS is a charity."", ""The source text doesn't state there are 25 licensing boards but that 25 statments by such boards have been published""]",inconsistent
"Scientists and celebrities were among those who turned out for the first March for Science, part of a string of events across the UK and the world. Organisers said the growth of fake news and misinformation made it crucial to highlight science's ""vital role"". It took place on Earth Day, which promotes environmental protection. Supporters gathered outside the Science Museum in Kensington, bearing placards on which double helices and chemical symbols sat alongside political slogans. Thousands then marched to Parliament Square passing institutions such as the Royal Society. Many of them were protesting against what they see as a trend among politicians for discrediting scientific research. Concerns that rhetoric threatens to override research flared in the UK last summer when former cabinet minister Michael Gove claimed during the EU referendum campaign that the public had ""had enough of experts"". In the US, President Donald Trump has previously called climate change a ""hoax"", raising concern in the scientific community there that the public were beginning to doubt the facts provided as scientific evidence. Organisers said the events were also a celebration of science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community. Doctor Who star Peter Capaldi and comedian Robin Ince were among those who joined activists in London. Mr Ince, who hosts the scientific podcast The Infinite Monkey Cage, said: ""I think there are many reasons people are out here. ""I think we're worried about the fact there seems to be a reigniting of parochialism in politics... ""I think the idea of deriding experts, the idea of deriding people that spend their entire life researching and experimenting, is a return to charlatanism if we start doing that."" The Commons Science and Technology Committee this month stressed the importance of allowing scientists and experts to come to the UK following Brexit. It followed a host of warnings from influential figures in the scientific community that divorce from the continent could have a crippling impact on research and provoke an exodus of talent. In March, Nobel Prize winning scientist Sir Paul Nurse said: ""I don't think there's anything in Brexit that helps universities, either in teaching or research, but we are where we are... we have to make the best of it.""

"It accused the leaders of the recall referendum movement of fraud. On Friday the National Electoral Council (CNE) declared more than 600,000 signatures on a petition for the referendum invalid. The opposition says the electoral authorities are biased against them. Venezuela is on the brink of economic collapse, facing high inflation and the shortage of food and basic goods. The opposition blames the Socialist policies of Mr Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, for the country's economic decline. The government says the country's economic elite, backed up by conservative forces in the United States and other countries, has been plotting to topple the government. One of Mr Maduro's closest allies, Jorge Rodriguez, has been appointed to check whether there are any irregularities in the recall referendum process. ""We have found a huge fraud against the Constitution,"" he said, after beginning legal action at the Supreme Court. ""Stop lying to the international community and stop lying to the Venezuelan people,"" he said. He stressed once again that it would not be possible to hold the referendum this year as the opposition wishes. On Saturday, Mr Maduro said the recall referendum would be held in 2017 if the opposition met the legal requirements. ""If they don't meet the requirements, there will be no recall referendum, full stop,"" said Mr Maduro. Timing is essential for both sides. If the referendum is held by 10 January 2017 and President Maduro loses, a new election will be called. If it is held after that date and the vote goes against him, his vice-president takes over and remains in power until the end of the presidential term, in January 2019.

"UKIP's leader told the Sunday Telegraph the risk of attacks like those in Cologne, Germany, would be ""the nuclear bomb"" of the referendum campaign. But Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom, who backs Brexit, said he was wrong. ""Obviously that is just an outrageous thing to say,"" she told the BBC. Allegations that hundreds of women were groped, robbed and intimidated at Cologne's central station on New Year's Eve emerged in January. Victims described chaos outside the city's main station, as the men - some of whom were identified in an official report as migrants or asylum seekers of North African and Arab origin - carried out dozens of attacks with little apparent response from the authorities. Mr Farage claimed women could be at risk because of ""very big cultural"" issues between British society and migrants if the UK voted to remain in the EU, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Asked whether mass attacks on the scale seen in Cologne could happen in Britain, he replied: ""It depends if they get EU passports. It depends if we vote for Brexit or not. It is an issue."" The UKIP leader made the comments ahead of a live TV debate on ITV on Thursday. During last year's TV general election debates, Mr Farage sparked controversy by claiming foreign HIV patients were costing the NHS Â£25,000 each per year. ""The nuclear bomb this time would be about Cologne,"" he told the Telegraph. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. Rather than backing her fellow Brexit campaigner's comments, Tory MP Ms Leadsom told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I don't like that sort of campaigning at all."" ""However we know for a fact that there was an appalling experience for women over in Germany over the Christmas period. ""I do not approve of that sort of campaigning, I do not believe in outright blatant scaremongering so I think it's really, really regrettable. ""I haven't seen it and I wouldn't support suggesting if you vote to remain you'd be raped."" Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a prominent Brexit campaigner, also refused to associate himself with Mr Farage's comments. ""He's made those remarks and I haven't made remarks like that and I won't make remarks like that,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. Sal Brinton, president of the Liberal Democrats, said Farage had ""sunk to new depths in his scaremongering with these remarks which are completely unacceptable"".

"The prime minister said he appreciated people were ""disillusioned"" with the EU and he ""absolutely understood and received the message"". He told the BBC that only Conservatives offered a referendum on UK membership. The BBC's Nick Robinson said this ""simple message"" instilled confidence for many within the party. UKIP gained 23 MEPs, with the Tories having 19, behind Labour which has 20. The Conservative share of the vote was 23.9%, behind Labour on 25.4% and UKIP on 27.5%. Some Conservative MPs have expressed dismay at the performance and Mr Cameron said he was ""disappointed"" for the MEPs - including its former leader in Brussels Martin Callanan - who lost their seats. But he said the vote reinforced his belief that the UK's relationship with the EU needed to change. ""I take a very clear message from the election. People are deeply disillusioned with the EU. They don't feel the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain and they want change. ""I would say that message is absolutely received and understood."" While he was an instinctive ""reformer"" who, in the referendum would ""give the choice to the British people of whether to stay or go"", Labour backed the ""status quo"" in Europe and the Lib Dems did not want any change. Mr Cameron rejected suggestions that UKIP's victory was a snub for the Westminster elite in general and for Mr Farage's different campaigning style, saying the UKIP leader was a ""consummate politician"" who was already discussing tactics for the 2015 general election. He again dismissed any talk of pre-election pacts, at either a national or constituency level, saying he was ""100%"" focused on delivering an outright Conservative victory. He said Labour had got a lower share of the vote in the 2004 European election and managed to comfortably win a general election the year after. ""It is possible to win from here,"" he said. ""We have just got to have a real focus on what really matters which is completing our economic plan and turning our country round."" Foreign Secretary William Hague said the rise of Eurosceptic parties should serve as a wake-up call to European politicians. UKIP's support would switch for next year's general election, he told BBC News. ""They can have a free hit; they can have a vote that does not have the consequences of bringing the wrong government in,"" he said. ""So it is very different to a general election."" But backbencher Bernard Jenkin wrote on Twitter: ""Some of us who opposed Maastricht 20 years ago predicted it would lead to the rise of the right in the EU: and here we are."" And Clacton MP Douglas Carswell added: ""So maybe those of us who sometimes banged on about Europe were on to something?""
