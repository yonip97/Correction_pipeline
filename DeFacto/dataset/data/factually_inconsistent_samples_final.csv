"The report for 2015 is due out in the next few weeks, so the most recent report we have is the 2014 one. In the year covered by that report, 1,013 tests were conducted for IPC sports (which include athletics, swimming, powerlifting and skiing) in which prohibited substances were found nine times. During the year, sanctions were taken against 11 athletes. If you break that down into the sports involved it is clear that most of the IPC's anti-doping problems come from the sport of powerlifting, which was the source of seven of the positive tests and eight of the sanctions. The IPC announced in 2014 that it had suspended 13 powerlifters in the previous 14 months. The sport has been targeted with a ""Raise the Bar - Say No! to Doping"" campaign. Since then, the IPC has also adopted a new anti-doping code, which came into effect on 1 January 2015. Paralympic athletes have the same list of banned substances as Olympic athletes and, like them, anyone who requires additional medication for pain or treatment must apply for an exemption. ""It's a common misconception that a lot of Paralympians will be on prescription drugs. That's not the case at all,"" Nicole Sapstead, UK Anti-Doping chief executive, told the BBC ahead of London 2012. ""Obviously there are athletes with spinal injuries and they need pain relief. But mostly it is the same as the Olympics - things like asthma and diabetes."" Only one athlete was given a doping sanction at the Sochi Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, but since then the McLaren Report for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia's sports ministry manipulated urine samples provided by its athletes between 2011 and 2015. The report identified 27 samples relating to eight Para-sports, five of which are summer sports, including some governed by the IPC. The IPC also found evidence that samples were swapped during the Sochi Winter Paralympics, adding that it planned to reanalyse every Russian sample given at the event. So now the Russian team has been banned from this year's Paralympic Games in Rio, and the IPC is wondering if it has more of a doping problem than it previously thought.",Every four years the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) releases its annual anti-doping report.,"['The summary makes up the full name of the IPC', ""The summary makes up that there's 4 years between reports"", 'The summary states that the IPC releases an annual anti-doping report, but the text does not explicitly state that the report is specifically an ""anti-doping"" report.

A senior Nato official confirmed that three American contractors had been killed in the attack in the Macrorayan district. No group has said it carried out the attack, although in recent months Kabul has been regularly targeted by the Taliban in a series of bombings. The explosion took place not far from Kabul airport and the presidential palace. Witnesses said that children were among the injured and some foreigners were trapped in a destroyed vehicle. An interior ministry spokesman quoted by the AP news agency said the blast destroyed more than a dozen civilian vehicles. The bombing, close to a civilian hospital, is the latest in a series of recent deadly attacks following the announcement of a new Taliban leader. Earlier this month, a Taliban suicide bomber attacked a checkpoint near the entrance to the international airport in Kabul, killing five people. Before that, there were three deadly attacks in the city - on a police academy, a Nato base and an Afghan army base that killed at least 50 people. The Taliban has stepped up its campaign of violence in recent months, taking advantage of the warmer weather of spring and summer.

"The charges were laid in 2014 after a number of women complained to Toronto police that Mr Ghomeshi had been physically violent towards them. He denies all the charges, saying his actions were consensual rough sex. If convicted, the 48-year-old - who was sacked by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in 2014 - could be sent to prison for life. At CBC he hosted the popular arts show Q. A crowd of reporters and onlookers met Mr Ghomeshi as he arrived at court in Toronto on Monday. He faces four counts of sexual assault and one count of choking. A number of women earlier accused him of punching, strangling and battering, and three of the alleged victims later became plaintiffs in the case. Throughout the investigation, he denied the allegations and later pleaded not guilty to all the charges. The CBC began an inquiry into Mr Ghomeshi's sexual activities after Canada's Toronto Star newspaper began investigating allegations by an ex-girlfriend that he had engaged in non-consensual, violent sex with her.

"It is the last day of the Indian prime minister's tour of China and he is meeting some of the heads of Chinese industry. He will be hoping that they will be able to drive forward his signature policy, 'Make in India'. But one year into his term as prime minister and many say Mr Modi is showing some distinctly undemocratic tendencies as he tries to foster a manufacturing boom in India. At the end of April, India cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded non-governmental organisations (NGOs), saying they didn't comply with the country's tax codes. And the Indian government has singled out the environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, for special attention. The reason why says a lot, both about Mr Modi's ambitions for India and his attitude to dissent. This week Greenpeace won a small victory. On Wednesday the government lifted its ban on activist Priya Pillai travelling abroad. In January she was stopped from travelling to the UK to testify to British MPs about the effects of coal mining in India. But the war is far from over. The charity says it will have to close down in a matter of weeks unless the Indian government lifts the financial freeze it has imposed on the NGO. A secret report from India's Intelligence Bureau, leaked last year, explains why India's government has such a beef with the environmental charity. It said campaigns headed by Greenpeace and other NGOs had drained three percentage points off the nation's annual growth rate. Greenpeace wouldn't claim to have been anywhere near that influential but its campaign against the coal industry does strike at the heart of the 'Make in India' policy. Coal is the main source of power in India and is central to the BJP government's plans to boost industrial production. It is also the most polluting of all fossil fuels and a key driver of climate change. And, when it comes to coal, India compares poorly even with China, as Mr Modi's visit highlights. China's coal use of coal has been falling steeply, helping stall world growth in CO2 emissions. Meanwhile India's CO2 emissions are forecast to rise rapidly. According to the International Energy Agency, India is set to double its coal consumption by 2035 and become the world's largest coal importer by around 2020. Almost half of the 1,200 new coal-fired power stations proposed around the world are in India according to the World Resources Institute. That's why campaigning against the coal industry in India has been a priority for Greenpeace. The charity's campaigns have stopped coal mining in some of India's forest areas. The NGO will also have earned the government's ire by its relentless attack on two of India's corporate behemoths, Coal India and the Adani Group. Coal India is the biggest coal company in the world and India's fifth largest company. The Adani Group is the third biggest coal company in world and its head, Gautam Adani, is known to be close to the Indian prime minister. But the Indian government's attempt to muzzle Greenpeace and other NGOs has generated a chorus of criticism. India likes to celebrate its status as the world's largest democracy but the American ambassador to India has said its harassment of NGOs had a ""chilling effect"" on the nation's democracy. When the Indian electorate voted Mr Modi into power with a handsome majority a year ago they were voting for his promise to transform the Indian economy. Mr Modi is clearly determined to deliver on that promise. Indeed some Indians now fear that he may compromise some of the country's other core values along the way.",Narendra Modi is sitting down with a group of Chinese business leaders in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.,"[""The summary mentions Prime Minister Modi's first name is Narendra, which is true, but the source text doesn't mention the Prime Minister's first name."", ""The summary mentions that the Prime Minister will meet with Chinese leaders in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.

"The FTSE 100 index closed 2.27% higher, while the FTSE 250 closed up 1.68%. The pound fell 1.2% against the dollar to $1.3264 after Mr Carney said a deteriorating outlook meant action from the Bank was likely during the summer. Shares in the US rose, with both the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index up by 0.6% in morning trading. The past few days have seen huge swings on the world's financial markets as traders and investors struggled to assess the impact of the UK's vote to leave the European Union. After two days of heavy falls following the vote, shares spent two days recovering, and on Wednesday, the FTSE 100 ended above the level it had closed at last Thursday. However, the FTSE 250 index - which contains more UK-focused companies - still remains well below its pre-referendum level. ""The blue chip [FTSE 100] index is stuffed full with big international firms and it is these companies propelling the rise. The heavy weighting towards these groups is very misleading,"" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. ""The likes of Fresnillo, Randgold, AstraZeneca, Royal Dutch Shell, British American Tobacco - these are hardly dependent on, or reflective of, the UK economy. They're listed in London but their earnings come from abroad. ""There is a key distinction. UK-focused firms are doing much, much worse. Easyjet, Lloyds, Barclays, RBS, Barratt, Taylor Wimpey - they've all recorded 20% losses since the Brexit vote."" Shares in RBS were one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 on Thursday, dropping 4.8%. The pound is well below the $1.50 rate it touched last Thursday before the outcome of the referendum became clear. As well as falling against the dollar after Mr Carney's speech, it also tumbled 1.1% against the euro at â‚¬1.1962. Analysts continued to warn that the recent market recovery might only be temporary. ""The odds may be against them, but investors are hoping that the worst is over for currencies and equities,"" Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said in a note. ""But considering there's been no additional clarity on the terms of Brexit or the outlook for the UK economy and global economy since Britain's decision to leave the European Union on Friday, we don't see fundamental support for the recent moves."" Analysts at Swiss bank UBS have cut their end of year forecast for the FTSE 100 to 5,500 from 6,500. ""We see a significant amount of uncertainty around the UK over the next few months. We do not know who the prime minister will be, or when, or if, Article 50 is invoked and there are even possibilities of a general election given the current fluidity of UK politics,"" UBS said.

"Mr Green was charged after arriving at Livingston police station. Mr Whyte later attended a police station in Glasgow and was detained in custody. A third man, former Rangers co-administrator David Whitehouse, was earlier arrested in England. All three men are expected to appear at Glasgow Sherriff Court on Wednesday. Craig Whyte, 44, took over Rangers in May 2011. The club entered administration the following year. Charles Green led the consortium which bought Rangers assets in 2012 following the club's liquidation. But he stepped down from Rangers a year later following allegations that he was working in conjunction with Craig Whyte. A police spokesman said: ""Police Scotland can confirm a 44-year-old man has been arrested and is presently detained in police custody in connection with an ongoing investigation into an alleged fraudulent acquisition of Rangers FC in 2012. ""A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal."" An earlier police statement said a 62-year-old man had been arrested and detained over the same investigation. Arriving at the police station on Tuesday morning, Mr Green, 62, said: ""I've been invited to attend an interview with Police Scotland. I have done that on a number of occasions in the past."" Asked why he was there, Mr Green replied: ""Well, one of the difficulties with today is my legal people had asked Police Scotland to provide us information that we're likely to be questioned on and they wouldn't provide that so I'm at a loss really.""

"One officer was killed and 10 people injured as police and occupiers confronted each other. Locals occupied the mine and refused to leave until the miners paid them a ""tribute"". They allege that the mine lies on their ancestral lands and they should be compensated by those exploiting it. There are conflicting reports as to how police Sergeant Jose Luis Quispe died. A lawyer for the miners said he was pushed over a precipice by the squatters. But one of the squatters said the officer fell as he was fleeing the clashes. Other witnesses said Sgt Quispe lost his balance after the protesters threw an explosive device in his direction. Interior Minister Carlos Romero said his death would be investigated and those responsible would be punished harshly. One of the occupiers told local radio that the violence was triggered when more than 200 officers were sent to evict them. He warned that if the officers were not recalled, locals would block roads. He said that the miners had tried to convince locals of the benefits their work would bring to the community. But he insisted that locals wanted compensation from the mining co-operative.

"Vern Cotter names his squad for the Championship on Tuesday, three months after a 35-34 quarter-final defeat. Referee Craig Joubert awarded the Wallabies a late penalty that replays suggested was an incorrect decision. ""You feel you're over it and then you see something and it brings it all back,"" Hogg told BBC Scotland. ""I was watching something on the TV a couple of weeks ago about the legacy of the World Cup and when us going out came up, it just brought back horrible memories. It was bitterly disappointing."" Hogg is set to be included in a squad missing the injured Harlequins wing Tim Visser - ruled out of at least the first two games - and flanker Alasdair Strokosch, who retired from Test rugby after the World Cup. Another injury concern is Glasgow centre Mark Bennett, who was due to see a specialist on Monday to determine whether he needs an operation on his injured shoulder. The involvement of Warriors pair Ryan Wilson and Tim Swinson could hinge on the outcome of disciplinary proceedings against them following the European Champions Cup loss at Northampton. But club-mate and fellow midfielder Alex Dunbar could return to the Scotland fold after missing the World Cup with the after-effects of a knee injury sustained in training during last year's Six Nations. After the Calcutta Cup opener against England at Murrayfield on 6 February, Scotland travel to Cardiff - one of three away fixtures in this year's campaign - to face Wales in their second match a week later. Hogg says the squad will be desperate to banish the memories of not only their World Cup despair, but the embarrassment of a Six Nations whitewash last year. ""It is another challenge for us now, but we can take immense confidence from the World Cup,"" said the 23-year-old, who has only tasted victory in three of his 19 Six Nations matches since his 2012 debut. ""If I'm fortunate enough to be picked, hopefully we can produce something special in this Six Nations. England first up at Murrayfield is exactly what you want and it would be great to be part of that. ""Getting a good couple of wins early doors would give us immense confidence going forward, and we'd be in the tournament if that happens. ""We have let ourselves down in the last couple of Six Nations but we are looking forward to it."" Hogg and his Glasgow team-mates will be hoping that joining up with Scotland provides a catalyst for rediscovering their World Cup form. Four successive defeats since Christmas have seen them slip to eighth in the Pro 12 table and effectively exit the European Champions Cup, after a third pool defeat on Sunday to Northampton. ""Our target was to become the number one team in Europe and we've fallen short again,"" Hogg noted. ""It's fine and well having good performances here and there but it's wins that we need. Europe is the be-all and end-all of club rugby so we're bitterly disappointed to no longer be part of it."" After their final Champions Cup game against pool leaders Racing 92 at Kilmarnock's Rugby Park on Saturday, Glasgow - eight points off the Pro 12 play-off positions, but with two games in hand - must turn their attention to restoring last season's lustre.

Zverev has been widely tipped as the teenager most likely to make the breakthrough among the game's elite and he went agonisingly close to a landmark win over Nadal. The 6ft 6in German, the younger brother of tour player Mischa Zverev, led 5-3 and 40-30 in the final set, only to make three straight unforced errors. Nadal, 29, battled back impressively, but had glowing praise for the teenager, who is set to rise to a career-high ranking of 52 next week. ""He is amazingly talented,"" said Nadal. ""He is probably going to be the number one in the world. ""With his second serve at 120mph, with a lot of spin and at 124, 123, 120mph, it was impossible. If he puts the first serve in at over 130 mph then you are in big trouble. ""So I think that I'm here, and still alive."" The world number one beat Spain's Feliciano Lopez 6-3 6-3 to set up a quarter-final with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France. Djokovic had not been at his best in the previous rounds but saw off Lopez with little trouble. ""I was very solid. I didn't allow him to come to the net too many times,"" said the Serb. ""It was a good performance."" David Goffin beat French Open champion and third seed Stan Wawrinka 6-3 5-7 7-6 (7-5), while Milos Raonic knocked out sixth seed Tomas Berdych 6-4 7-6 (9-7).

"Mustafa Bashir, 34, also forced bleach into her mouth, but the judge in Manchester said his sentence took into account his wife was not ""vulnerable"". Both Jess Phillips, Labour, and Maria Miller, Conservative, said they were concerned by the case and would write to the attorney general. Bashir's ex-wife said she was ""disappointed"" by the judge's comments. At Manchester Crown Court, Bashir of Hebers Court, Middleton, Manchester, admitted two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Judge Richard Mansell said his decision on the sentence was guided by the fact he was ""not convinced [Bashir's then wife] was a vulnerable person"" as she was ""an intelligent woman with a network of friends"" and a degree. Despite acknowledging the attacks had an ""ongoing effect"" on his victim's ability to trust people, he sentenced Bashir, who played cricket for Oldham, to 18 months, suspended for two years. Speaking to the BBC, which has agreed not to use her name, Bashir's ex-wife said she was ""disappointed in the comments which the judge made about my vulnerability"". She added: ""I am a confident and strong woman because of what I have suffered. I was suffering for my life but the judge didn't believe me."" The judge also ordered Bashir to attend a workshop entitled ''building better relationships'', pay Â£1,000 costs and banned him from contacting his ex-wife indefinitely. Ms Phillips, who is MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the judge's comments sent a ""dangerous"" message. ""Your vulnerability and your risk is a completely dynamic thing,"" she said. ""Everybody has a dynamic risk, I've met women who went on to be murdered who had law degrees, who were very eminent business people. ""There's no category that domestic violence does not touch.

"The Information Commissioner is to be asked to overrule a decision by the National Archives to keep the documents about the trial of Stephen Ward hidden. The submission is being made by lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC. It is believed Ward killed himself as his trial for living off immoral earnings was ending. Ward, an artist and osteopath living in London, had in 1961 introduced 21-year-old reputed call girl Christine Keeler to the Secretary of State for War, John Profumo. The minister and Ms Keeler - who is also thought to have had relations with an attache at the Russian embassy, Yevgeny Ivanov - started an affair. When challenged, Profumo initially denied the relationship - but was later forced to admit that he had lied in March 1963, in a scandal that threatened to topple the Conservative government of the time. Ward, who many believe was a victim of a cover-up, is understood to have killed himself on the last day of his trial at the Old Bailey, where he was found guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Ms Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies, who were referred to at the time of the court case as prostitutes. Mr Robertson, the author of Stephen Ward was Innocent, OK, said that he was making the appeal because keeping documents about Ward's trial hidden ""was irrational and ignores the public interest and the interests of history in discovering the truth about Ward's conviction, which is widely viewed as a miscarriage of justice"". He added: ""Releasing the official trial transcript is important to work out why Ward was ever prosecuted, and it will assist the case for overturning his conviction."" The National Archives refused Mr Robertson access to most of its file on Ward, which is believed to include the police statements used to charge him with living off the earnings of Ms Keeler and Ms Rice-Davies. Mr Robertson argues in his book that neither woman was a prostitute, and both in fact lived off Ward's earnings as a celebrated osteopath and portrait artist. The file on Ward is currently closed from public view until 2046, because this is 100 years after the birth of Ms Rice-Davies, the youngest of the trial witnesses. The Information Commissioner is set to make a decision to see if it can be opened earlier. According to Mr Robertson, this ""will cast an important new light on one of the worst miscarriages of justice in modern British history, and help explain how Stephen Ward was made the scapegoat for the Profumo affair by prosecuting him for crimes that neither he nor anyone else ever committed"". A spokesman for the National Archives said it did not want to provide a comment.

"The man hid himself in the rear wheel compartment of the plane which landed at Heathrow Airport on Sunday. He was taken into police custody in London but later released without charge. He had bruises and hypothermia from outside temperatures as low as -41C, Austrian media reported. He survived because the plane flew at a low altitude to avoid stormy weather. The man apparently got under a fence at Schwechat airport in Vienna and climbed into the undercarriage of the first plane he saw without knowing its destination. The plane belonged to a sheikh from the United Arab Emirates and had been standing empty on the tarmac at Schwechat airport since Thursday. It flew without passengers to Heathrow, where the Romanian was picked up by police and arrested for stowing away. He could have been charged or fined or given a fixed penalty, the Metropolitan Police told the BBC. But he was cautioned and freed with no further action being taken, PA news agency reported. The man could also have been handed to the UK Border Agency. But it is understood that there is no immigration issue and that the agency will not seek to deport him, according to PA. As Romania is part of the EU, the man is free to enter the UK. A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the stowaway was ""very lucky"" to be alive. ""If they don't find the right part to stow away, they can be crushed when the undercarriage comes up,"" he said. He added: ""Because of the altitude and temperatures during the flight, there is a severe risk to them through exposure and lack of oxygen.

"Derek Mackay is meeting other finance ministers for a ""quadrilateral"" summit in Edinburgh. He said he would raise ""unnecessary"" tax burdens with the chief secretary to the treasury during the meeting. The Treasury said Scottish ministers had been advised of the tax situation before setting up national services. Most other police and fire services in the UK are regional bodies and do not have to pay VAT. The issue arose because Scotland's policing and fire services were previously controlled by local councils, which can claim back the tax - but the new national forces set up in 2013 are controlled by the Scottish government, which cannot. Mr Mackay said the police and fire services were struggling with the ""unnecessary"" burden of tax which they ""simple should not have to pay"". He said: ""This is a significant sum which other emergency services do not have to meet. ""There is a significant difference in the way VAT affects emergency services across the UK, with Scottish police and fire services paying VAT when other territorial services in the UK do not have to. ""There needs to be a level playing field for such essential services. ""As we continue to invest in our emergency services we will continue to press the UK government for Scottish emergency services to have the same ability to recover VAT as all other British and Northern Irish Forces.""

A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""In 2012 the Scottish government chose to make Scotland's police and fire services national rather than regional bodies. The Scottish government were advised in advance that by making this change Scottish police and fire services would become ineligible for VAT refunds.""

Ms Davidson replied: ""The Scottish government was warned about VAT - it knew what would happen and it did not listen to parliament.

"Lough Swilly lifeboat station is the first in Ireland to get the brand new Shannon Class lifeboat. The 2.4m euros (Â£1.8m) boat was built in England and is the smallest, fastest and lightest in the RNLI fleet.

Peter Eyre who is now an RNLI naval architect based in Poole, in England was instrumental in the development of the new lifeboat.

"Dan Lawrence (75) and Adam Wheater's (64) 127-run partnership helped Essex create a platform before they were all out for 295, having resumed on 120-4. Middlesex, also aided by Toby Roland-Jones' 3-81, chose to not enforce the follow on, despite being 212 ahead. Sam Robson hit 77 and Nick Gubbins 64 as the hosts declared on 239-3, and Essex ended 19-0 chasing 452 to win. Given the forecast for rain on the final day, the decision not to put Essex back in to bat again was surprising. However, Robson and Gubbins built on their first-innings centuries to ensure the best chance for victory possible if the weather holds out. After dismissing former England captain Alastair Cook cheaply on day two, Roland-Jones took his third wicket of the match with the 14th ball of the third morning, as Ravi Bopara was caught at third slip, continuing his poor batting form this season. That brought Wheater to the crease, and alongside Lawrence the pair dragged Essex away from a disastrous reply to Middlesex's 507-7 declared, but Wheater was eventually out to a brilliant one-handed tumbling catch by Stevie Eskinazi at square leg to reduce the visitors to 253-6. Ryan ten Doeschate (20) was then trapped plumb lbw by Tim Murtagh, Simon Harmer hit a wide ball to Eskinazi's hands, and Lawrence and Neil Wagner were dismissed by Finn (4-51) as the final four wickets tumbled in nine overs. At a pace of more than six runs an over, Middlesex thundered to a lead of 451, thanks to Robson, Gubbins and fellow first-innings centurion Eskinazi, who hit 62 in 34 balls, going to his fifty with three successive sixes into the Grand Stand off Jamie Porter.

"In 1787, the 28-year-old Robert Burns was suddenly a ""celebrity"", according to Prof Nigel Leask, regius chair of English Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow. The 2nd Edinburgh edition of his poems had given him a quite a handsome pot of money and it had also made him famous, with the cream of Scottish society taking an interest in him. Prof Leask says: ""He was the lion of Scottish literature, everyone wants to meet him."" And Burns also wants to meet them, especially if they have the power to promote his work further and the cash to buy his books. ""Poets in the 18th Century depended on patronage so he tours around the gentry and nobles, really doing a bit of salesmanship,"" says Prof Leask. Throughout 1787 Burns embarked on a series of tours, firstly around the Scottish Borders and northern England and then further afield to the west Highlands taking in Inveraray, Arrochar and dinner with Glasgow tobacco merchant George Buchanan at Arden House at Bannachra near Loch Lomond. Later in the year he toured the Highlands during which time he stayed with the Duke and Duchess of Atholl at Blair Castle, dined with the Duke and Duchess of Gordon at Castle Gordon and visited historical sites such as the Culloden battlefield and Cawdor Castle, which featured in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Prof Leask says that Burns seems to have had letters of introduction from Edinburgh patrons that gained him access to the upper-echelons of Scottish nobility. ""He's not overawed by his posh surroundings,"" says Prof Leask. ""It shows his amazing social versatility. He's got an ability to move in all the circles of society. ""There is a sense of how thoroughly he was in the society and culture of the late 18th Century."" Prof Leask says: ""It slightly qualifies the image of the 'heaven-taught ploughman' who does not have formal qualifications, who is just a genius endowed by nature. ""This shows how learned he was, how much he knew."" Prof Leask says the tours of the Highlands are also important because it was a Lowlander's encounter with Gaelic culture, the Highland culture of Scotland. During his travels he composes songs like the Birks of Aberfeldy and discovers his east coast heritage, visiting relatives in Stonehaven and Laurencekirk. His father's family had a strong connection to the Jacobites in the north east. As well as mixing with the Scottish nobility there was plenty of time for the rock star antics for which Burns has become well known. Prof Leask recounts how Burns stopped for the night at Arden House near Loch Lomond. ""He has a very convivial night of dancing and drinking and seeing the sun rise over Ben Lomond,"" says Prof Leask. ""He sets off the next day and has a horse race on the road down to Dumbarton with a Highland man he calls Donald, who is riding an unharnessed horse and Burns is riding Jenny Geddes, his old mare. ""He is determined not to be overtaken so he races and has an accident. ""It's a bit like two boy-racers on the A82 nowadays."" The tour journals are included in the new ""Oxford Edition of the Works of Robert Burns: Commonplace Books, Tour Journals and Miscellaneous Prose"". Prof Leask says: ""This is the first time the tours have been edited to scholarly standards and cross-referenced with his poems, songs and letters. ""It enables the reader to get a good sense of how these tours contributed to his emergence as a major world poet.""","As the 200th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns is marked, BBC Scotland looks at his travels around Scotland in the 18th Century.","[""The source text does not mention the 200th anniversary of Robert Burns' birth"", 'The source text does not mention BBC scotland at all.']",,0
"A report published by Alcohol Focus Scotland (AFS) claimed often concerns of local people were ignored by boards. It suggested more boards highlighted the economic importance of the licensed trade than the damaging consequences of alcohol. And it found more than half had extended licensing hours over the past six years. Boards must publish statements of licensing policy every three years, with the latest round to run until 2016. AFS analysed the 25 which had been published by the end of April 2014 and said some progress has been made in how they are controlling the availability of alcohol. But its chief executive, Dr Evelyn Gillan, said the licensing process was too removed from the people and neighbourhoods most affected by the boards' decisions. She said: ""Licensing boards have an important role in trying to minimise the harm that alcohol can cause because they have the power to control how much alcohol is available in their areas. ""The good news is that some boards are working well with the police and health professionals, declaring more areas of overprovision and actively seeking the views of local communities in licensing decision-making."" However, she added: ""There is a lack of transparency about how the evidence of alcohol harm presented to licensing boards by health, police, and local people has been listened to and acted upon."" The number of alcohol licences in Scotland has remained broadly static in recent years, according to government figures. In 2012/13 there were 16,237 premises licences across Scotland - 11,363 on-sales and 4,874 off-sales. That was slightly down on the previous 12 months (16,379), and on the figure for 2010/11 (16,377). Among the findings of the report were: . Ch Supt Mark Williams, police commander in Edinburgh said: ""My staff and other public agencies have made strong representation to the licensing authority highlighting the very clear link between the availability of alcohol and increased harm. ""In a policing context this usually manifests as anti-social behaviour, disorder and violence."" AFS said there was some good practice where boards had taken into account the views of police, health professionals and local community groups. They included in Glasgow, North Ayrshire, Aberdeen, Dumfries and Galloway, Highland and East Lothian. Fiona Moss, head of health improvement at Glasgow City Community Health Partnership said: ""We were invited to give evidence during the consultation process and I was pleased with the way the licensing board considered this evidence and listened to the principal health messages. ""I welcomed the board's decision not to further extend routine licensing hours and not to grant further breakfast licences within the new policy."" The AFS report recommended boards should produce detailed statistics to enable effective monitoring of the licensing system.","There is a ""lack of transparency"" in how Scotland's 25 licensing boards deal with alcohol, according to a charity.","[""The source text doesn't state AFS is a charity."", ""The source text doesn't state there are 25 licensing boards but that 25 statments by such boards have been published""]",,0
"Scientists and celebrities were among those who turned out for the first March for Science, part of a string of events across the UK and the world. Organisers said the growth of fake news and misinformation made it crucial to highlight science's ""vital role"". It took place on Earth Day, which promotes environmental protection. Supporters gathered outside the Science Museum in Kensington, bearing placards on which double helices and chemical symbols sat alongside political slogans. Thousands then marched to Parliament Square passing institutions such as the Royal Society. Many of them were protesting against what they see as a trend among politicians for discrediting scientific research. Concerns that rhetoric threatens to override research flared in the UK last summer when former cabinet minister Michael Gove claimed during the EU referendum campaign that the public had ""had enough of experts"". In the US, President Donald Trump has previously called climate change a ""hoax"", raising concern in the scientific community there that the public were beginning to doubt the facts provided as scientific evidence. Organisers said the events were also a celebration of science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community. Doctor Who star Peter Capaldi and comedian Robin Ince were among those who joined activists in London. Mr Ince, who hosts the scientific podcast The Infinite Monkey Cage, said: ""I think there are many reasons people are out here. ""I think we're worried about the fact there seems to be a reigniting of parochialism in politics... ""I think the idea of deriding experts, the idea of deriding people that spend their entire life researching and experimenting, is a return to charlatanism if we start doing that."" The Commons Science and Technology Committee this month stressed the importance of allowing scientists and experts to come to the UK following Brexit. It followed a host of warnings from influential figures in the scientific community that divorce from the continent could have a crippling impact on research and provoke an exodus of talent. In March, Nobel Prize winning scientist Sir Paul Nurse said: ""I don't think there's anything in Brexit that helps universities, either in teaching or research, but we are where we are... we have to make the best of it."" Parallel marches were hosted across the UK, including in Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff and Edinburgh.

In September four Peruvian tribal leaders were murdered on their way to a meeting to discuss ways to stop illegal logging. Berta Caceres, an indigenous Lenca woman, told the report's authors that she had received numerous death threats because of her opposition to a dam that would force her community off their ancestral land.

The 37-year-old was punished by the NFL (National Football League) after it was decided he was ""generally aware"" of a scheme to deflate footballs.

An NFL investigation claimed the Patriots had deflated match balls to give themselves an advantage in their 45-7 victory. They went on to win the Super Bowl XLIX. According to reports, 11 of the 12 game balls they provided for the rain-affected match were under-inflated below set standards by about two pounds per square inch, giving Brady more grip in the cold and wet conditions. Brady was ""at least generally aware of inappropriate activities"", according to the independent Wells Report.

"It accused the leaders of the recall referendum movement of fraud. On Friday the National Electoral Council (CNE) declared more than 600,000 signatures on a petition for the referendum invalid. The opposition says the electoral authorities are biased against them. Venezuela is on the brink of economic collapse, facing high inflation and the shortage of food and basic goods. The opposition blames the Socialist policies of Mr Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, for the country's economic decline. The government says the country's economic elite, backed up by conservative forces in the United States and other countries, has been plotting to topple the government. One of Mr Maduro's closest allies, Jorge Rodriguez, has been appointed to check whether there are any irregularities in the recall referendum process. ""We have found a huge fraud against the Constitution,"" he said, after beginning legal action at the Supreme Court. ""Stop lying to the international community and stop lying to the Venezuelan people,"" he said. He stressed once again that it would not be possible to hold the referendum this year as the opposition wishes. On Saturday, Mr Maduro said the recall referendum would be held in 2017 if the opposition met the legal requirements. ""If they don't meet the requirements, there will be no recall referendum, full stop,"" said Mr Maduro. Timing is essential for both sides. If the referendum is held by 10 January 2017 and President Maduro loses, a new election will be called. If it is held after that date and the vote goes against him, his vice-president takes over and remains in power until the end of the presidential term, in January 2019. The opposition handed over the petition on 2 May. It said it had gathered the signatures of 1.85 million voters backing a recall referendum, many more than the 197,000 needed at this initial stage.

The voters whose signatures have not been struck off by the CNE - more than 1.3 million people - will need to turn up at regional electoral offices to confirm their identities later this month.

"UKIP's leader told the Sunday Telegraph the risk of attacks like those in Cologne, Germany, would be ""the nuclear bomb"" of the referendum campaign. But Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom, who backs Brexit, said he was wrong. ""Obviously that is just an outrageous thing to say,"" she told the BBC. Allegations that hundreds of women were groped, robbed and intimidated at Cologne's central station on New Year's Eve emerged in January. Victims described chaos outside the city's main station, as the men - some of whom were identified in an official report as migrants or asylum seekers of North African and Arab origin - carried out dozens of attacks with little apparent response from the authorities. Mr Farage claimed women could be at risk because of ""very big cultural"" issues between British society and migrants if the UK voted to remain in the EU, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Asked whether mass attacks on the scale seen in Cologne could happen in Britain, he replied: ""It depends if they get EU passports. It depends if we vote for Brexit or not. It is an issue."" The UKIP leader made the comments ahead of a live TV debate on ITV on Thursday. During last year's TV general election debates, Mr Farage sparked controversy by claiming foreign HIV patients were costing the NHS Â£25,000 each per year. ""The nuclear bomb this time would be about Cologne,"" he told the Telegraph. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. Rather than backing her fellow Brexit campaigner's comments, Tory MP Ms Leadsom told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I don't like that sort of campaigning at all."" ""However we know for a fact that there was an appalling experience for women over in Germany over the Christmas period. ""I do not approve of that sort of campaigning, I do not believe in outright blatant scaremongering so I think it's really, really regrettable. ""I haven't seen it and I wouldn't support suggesting if you vote to remain you'd be raped."" Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a prominent Brexit campaigner, also refused to associate himself with Mr Farage's comments. ""He's made those remarks and I haven't made remarks like that and I won't make remarks like that,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. Sal Brinton, president of the Liberal Democrats, said Farage had ""sunk to new depths in his scaremongering with these remarks which are completely unacceptable"". And Ryan Coetzee, director of strategy for the official remain campaign, Britain Stronger In Europe, tweeted to say Mr Farage's comments were ""disgraceful"", adding: ""Don't vote for this man's idea of Britain. But Mr Farage also told the Telegraph the ""honesty and straightforwardness"" of the prime minister was now being questioned by voters. Many believed Mr Cameron, who he dubbed ""Dishonest Dave"", had broken his promise to cut migration and renegotiate the UK's terms of membership of the EU, he said. Mr Cameron's ally, Chancellor George Osborne, took aim at the UKIP leader in an interview published in the Sunday Times. ""This is a battle between Farage's mean vision of Britain and the outward-facing, generous Britain that the mainstream of this country celebrates,"" he said. ""I say: we don't want Farage's Britain. That means voting to remain."" Meanwhile former PM Sir John Major hit out at the ""squalid"" and ""deceitful"" campaign to get Britain out of the EU. He told Andrew Marr he was ""angry about the way the British people are being misled"" by fellow Conservative Boris Johnson and Vote Leave.

"The prime minister said he appreciated people were ""disillusioned"" with the EU and he ""absolutely understood and received the message"". He told the BBC that only Conservatives offered a referendum on UK membership. The BBC's Nick Robinson said this ""simple message"" instilled confidence for many within the party. UKIP gained 23 MEPs, with the Tories having 19, behind Labour which has 20. The Conservative share of the vote was 23.9%, behind Labour on 25.4% and UKIP on 27.5%. Some Conservative MPs have expressed dismay at the performance and Mr Cameron said he was ""disappointed"" for the MEPs - including its former leader in Brussels Martin Callanan - who lost their seats. But he said the vote reinforced his belief that the UK's relationship with the EU needed to change. ""I take a very clear message from the election. People are deeply disillusioned with the EU. They don't feel the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain and they want change. ""I would say that message is absolutely received and understood."" While he was an instinctive ""reformer"" who, in the referendum would ""give the choice to the British people of whether to stay or go"", Labour backed the ""status quo"" in Europe and the Lib Dems did not want any change. Mr Cameron rejected suggestions that UKIP's victory was a snub for the Westminster elite in general and for Mr Farage's different campaigning style, saying the UKIP leader was a ""consummate politician"" who was already discussing tactics for the 2015 general election. He again dismissed any talk of pre-election pacts, at either a national or constituency level, saying he was ""100%"" focused on delivering an outright Conservative victory. He said Labour had got a lower share of the vote in the 2004 European election and managed to comfortably win a general election the year after. ""It is possible to win from here,"" he said. ""We have just got to have a real focus on what really matters which is completing our economic plan and turning our country round."" Foreign Secretary William Hague said the rise of Eurosceptic parties should serve as a wake-up call to European politicians. UKIP's support would switch for next year's general election, he told BBC News. ""They can have a free hit; they can have a vote that does not have the consequences of bringing the wrong government in,"" he said. ""So it is very different to a general election."" But backbencher Bernard Jenkin wrote on Twitter: ""Some of us who opposed Maastricht 20 years ago predicted it would lead to the rise of the right in the EU: and here we are."" And Clacton MP Douglas Carswell added: ""So maybe those of us who sometimes banged on about Europe were on to something?"" The European election results come just days after the Conservative Party lost more than 200 seats in local polls, prompting ministers to promise tougher curbs on immigration. Home Secretary Theresa May said they were considering deporting people who came to the UK to work, but who could not find a job after six months. They were also looking at cutting the length of time migrants could claim benefits from six months to three months, she said.

A coroner is writing to the director of Her Majesty's Prison Service demanding a review of the way officers are treated during disciplinary proceedings. The inquest heard Ms Norridge had ambitions of becoming a prison governor but was hit by a health scare - a relative had died of bowel cancer and she tested positive for a gene which gave her an 80 per cent chance of also getting the disease. The inquest was told she went to the doctor and was given three weeks off work to come to terms with the shock. But Ms Norridge went out with friends to see a live TV screening at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff of a 2011 Rugby World Cup match where she was seen by the colleague.

The 26-year-old featured in eight of Wales' qualifiers but injury ruled him out of the past four international friendlies. ""I'll be fit for the summer,"" he told BBC Wales Sport. ""I'm getting on well. No-one likes being injured, but it is just a little strain, so I am just managing it now and getting it right, and it will be right come the summer. ""I am definitely on the mend and looking forward to getting back fit."" Robson-Kanu, who is out of contract at the end of the season, expects to feature for Reading before the campaign finishes. ""I will hopefully play a few games and get my fitness up ahead of the camp and as we get ready for the summer,"" he said. Wales have qualified their first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup in Sweden and will face Slovakia, England and Russia at the European Championship. Robson-Kanu believes the success of Chris Coleman's team has helped to challenge the notion Wales is a rugby nation. ""Things have changed, there is this perception that Wales is a rugby nation and of course rugby is a massive part of this nation,"" he said. ""But if you look at the support Swansea and Cardiff get, especially when Cardiff were in the top league, it was fantastic. ""Now we are doing so well at international level, you can really feel the buzz and the attendances reflect that. ""We know how much it means to the fans, it is that special feeling isn't it?

"Winger Martin Donnelly scored the first with a low curling accurate shot from outside the box in the 35th minute. Just before half-time Ards keeper Ryan Brown made a brilliant save from striker David McDaid's penalty. McDaid did make it 2-0 on 62 minutes by turning the ball in from about six yards and late on sub Stephen Garrett wrapped it up with a close-range third. Seconds before Donnelly had netted the opener, Ards fluffed a great chance to take the lead when Jordan Baker put a six-yard header wide. And, just after going 2-0 down, Ards half-time substitute Stephen O'Neill went close to scoring against his former club but saw a header cleared off the line. The historic win also brought a first trophy for manager Gerard Lyttle, who last October took on the job of succeeding Tommy Breslin, the north Belfast club's most successful manager. Breslin, who had guided the Reds to eight trophies, stood down after Cliftonville's early-season league form stuttered. Lyttle, with Celtic for a spell as a player, took over originally on a temporary basis. But, after a promising start results-wise, the Solitude board gave Lyttle the full seal of approval and they will feel vindicated by this success. Ards had gone into the final as massive underdogs, even more so having agreed to play on their opponents' ground, rather than a neutral venue, to benefit from bigger gate receipts. Manager Niall Currie's main target is to get the North Down club, who were relegated in April 2014 and haven't had their own ground since the late 1990s, restored to the top flight of the Irish League. They will feel heartened. by giving a good account of themselves when the odds were stacked against them, and will be many people's favourites to go on and win the Championship One title. Cliftonville manager Gerard Lyttle: ""We told the lads to play themselves into the history books. ""Winning is everything to me and you have to get trophies at this club.

"The move comes after the BBC revealed that a number of women felt physically and mentally scarred after having the implants. Mesh or tape implants are used to treat organ prolapse or urinary incontinence. These conditions can be common after childbirth. The board's letter, leaked to the BBC, advised GPs to refer the women back to the health trust that performed the surgery with a letter stating that the referral is ""because of problems associated with mesh surgery"". The letter goes on to state that each trust should have arrangements in place for these women to be seen by a consultant. A spokesperson for the local action group, which now has over 250 members, welcomed the move but told the BBC that it was sad that some women had to go public with their personal stories in order for some health professionals to take them seriously.

Collin, who joined Rotherham from Carlisle United in 2013, has played twice this season. But he has not featured since August and recently found himself relegated to third choice. Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes hopes to have Ward available to face Ross County in their Scottish Premiership game in Dingwall. ""We're still waiting for international clearance for Adam and I'll announce the team on Sunday morning,"" he said. ""We'd assurances from Liverpool that Danny could stay, but their circumstances changed, so we're delighted to get Adam on board."" Ward impressed during his spell with the Dons and, on his return to Anfield, was immediately handed a place on the bench for the game against Arsenal.

""There was no approach for Cammy Bell, although I'm not saying his name wasn't mentioned,"" said McInnes.

"The Markit construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 55 from 57.8 - well below the 57.5 forecast by economists. The figure contrasted with a stronger-than-expected start for the manufacturing sector published on Monday. Factory output rose from 52.1 in December to 52.9 in January. Any figure above 50 indicates growth in the sector. Markit economist Tim Moore said construction firms were struggling for momentum, with increased economic uncertainty holding back new orders and contributing to one of the weakest rises in output levels since summer 2013. ""Taken together with the slowdown in new order growth, the latest survey suggests that construction companies are braced for a relatively subdued first quarter,"" he said. David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which compiles the survey along with Markit, said a shortage of bricks and blocks contributed to the slowdown. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said weakness in construction orders and a downturn in public sector infrastructure work, which accounts for about a quarter of total construction and is not covered by the PMI, suggested the sector would post only ""lacklustre growth"" this year. Optimism among construction companies waned to its lowest level since December 2014, the survey showed. ""Some firms highlighted concerns that underlying demand conditions had started to soften,"" Markit said. Analysts use the PMI surveys for early signals about the economy. However, the construction sector figures have been at odds with data used in official growth figures in recent months. Growth in the dominant UK service sector fell slightly in December to 55.5 in December, down from 59.9 in November, but remained above average.","Growth in the UK's construction sector slowed sharply in January, according to a closely watched survey.","['The source text does not indicate how closely the Markit construction PMI is watched.', 'The source text does not characterize the slowdown in the construction sector as ""sharp"" or in any other way.']",,0
"Two new pictures of the third in line to the throne have been released to mark the occasion on Tuesday. One shows Prince George transfixed by a butterfly, while a second shows him with his mother and father, staring at an object above their heads. In a statement the duke and duchess thanked people for their ""warm and generous good wishes"". The couple said: ""We would like to take this opportunity on George's first birthday to thank everyone over the last year, wherever we have met them, both at home and overseas, for their warm and generous good wishes to George and our family."" The duke and duchess are expected to hold a birthday party for the young prince on Tuesday at their Kensington Palace apartment. Prince George was first revealed to the public on the steps of St Mary's hospital in London on 23 July 2013. The couple and their son were also warmly welcomed when they travelled to New Zealand and Australia on a royal visit. An image of Prince George was released on Sunday and the new pictures published on Monday night complete the set. One shows the young royal fascinated by a blue morpho butterfly, which has landed on his father's hand. The other image shows the two future kings and the Duchess of Cambridge looking at an object above their heads. The pictures were taken a few weeks ago at London's Natural History Museum by the Press Association's John Stillwell. Just like many of the other 2,200 babies born in the UK on the same day, last year, George Alexander Louis will mark his birthday with a party. His though, will be at a palace and his guest of honour will be his great-grandmother, the Queen. Prince George offers the institution she has served for decades the prospect of renewal, but not - as things stand - for many years to come, after the reigns of his grandfather and his father. For now, the emphasis will be on him leading as normal a life as possible - not easy when you're a prince growing up in a palace - and on shielding the child, destined to be a king, from too much public exposure. But George will continue to fascinate and he will continue to be showered with presents. A Kenyan women's group has given the baby prince, who will one day inherit the Duchy of Cornwall's 53,000 hectares, two fattened bulls, a heifer and a goat. Sir Michael Dixon, director of the Natural History Museum, said: ""It was a real pleasure to host our patron and her family earlier this month.

"About 1,200 people died and 771 survived when the British liner was torpedoed by a German submarine on 7 May 1915 during World War One. One of the largest ships in the world, it was sailing from New York to its home port of Liverpool when it was sunk off the coast of Ireland. A minute's silence will be held at 14:10 BST - the time of the attack - at a service in Liverpool. The disaster provoked outrage especially in Britain, with rioters targeting German businesses in Merseyside, Manchester and London. Public opinion in the US, which had been officially neutral, was said to have changed after the death of about 130 Americans, although it was another two years before the country declared its official entry into the war, in 1917. Ian Murphy, from Merseyside Maritime Museum, said: ""In 1915, Lusitania was the world's most famous ship and the jewel in Liverpool's crown. ""Her sinking sent shockwaves around the globe and was said to have influenced America's entry to the war."" About 600 people onboard the Lusitania had links with Merseyside. The Reverend Dr Crispin Pailing, rector of Liverpool, said: ""A significant number of the crew and passengers had Liverpool connections - there is hardly a street in the Vauxhall area that wasn't affected."" The ship's owner Cunard has commissioned a memorial plaque, which will be dedicated later during a service at Liverpool Parish Church. Actors Joe McGann and Roy Carruthers will read first-hand accounts from survivors. A painting by the artist Anthony Brown, whose great-grandfather was on the Lusitania's final voyage, will be put on display for the first time. The service will be followed by a walk of remembrance to the Lusitania's salvaged propeller, now located at the city's Pier Head.

"They will meet on Monday afternoon to decide their response. The boss of the bank has described this plan as getting ""several holes in one in a row"". Golfers will know how hard that is and the wind of political risk has just picked up. If they do decide the plan is now too risky then the government may have no choice but to nationalise the bank. That would trigger a so-called ""bail in"" which means people who lent the bank money would have to write it off. Unfortunately, 65% of those creditors are ordinary retail investors so the damage would be widespread and politically toxic. There is another option. The Italian government could decide to simply break the rules and nationalise the bank without hitting small investors. That might be politically expedient but would be bitterly opposed in Germany and would set back immeasurably the project of banking union (separating the financial risk of banks from their governments - a move that came in response to the eurozone crisis of 2012). The money comes directly out of some small investors' pockets or it comes out of every citizen's taxes. The latter would be seen across Europe as a massive defeat in the battle to make sure taxpayers are not the first port of call when a bank fails.

"Biggin Hill Airport wants to increase bank holiday and weekend opening times to increase the number of flights. Director William Curtis said he feared the airport could be asked to help the UK meet increased demand for air travel if the extension was not granted. Bromley Council has approved new hours ""in principle"". The airport, which caters to the business and general aviation sectors, is pushing for an hours' extension on weekdays, five-and-a-half hours' extra flying time on Saturday, and a further four-hour increase on Sundays. Mr Curtis was asked whether he was ""scaremongering"" about taking holiday airlines during a BBC London interview. He said: ""What we will do is to ensure that we have set our stall out in the business and general aviation sector and we won't therefore be potentially looked at later by government as a solution to the capacity crisis.""

"Nonsuch Palace was painted by the Flemish artist Joris Hoefnagel in 1568. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on the watercolour in the hope a UK buyer can match the asking price of £1m. ""We have very few paintings of the palace so I really hope we can find a buyer to keep this masterpiece here in Britain,"" he said. The piece is the oldest of six remaining depictions of the palace, considered to be one of the Renaissance period's most stunning buildings. Nonsuch Palace - named because no other palace could equal it - was built in 1538 for the Tudor king to celebrate the birth of his first legitimate son and mark his 30th year on the throne, . It was intended to rival the opulent residences of French king Francis I. In 1670 Charles II gave the palace to his mistress, Barbara Villiers, who began to dismantle and sell parts of the building to pay off gambling debts. By 1690 the building had all but disappeared. The painting went for auction in 2010 but failed to meet its reserve price of £1.2m. The decision to defer the export licence follows a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA), administered by Arts Council England. They made their recommendation on the grounds of its close association with our history and national life, its outstanding aesthetic importance and its outstanding significance for understanding the nature of English Renaissance architecture.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its key rate to 2.75% from 3%. The bank said it expected investment in the resources sector, one of its biggest drivers of growth in recent times, to peak this year. It added that a rate cut would provide a boost to other areas of the economy and help sustain long-term growth. ""There has been a strengthening in consumption and a modest firming in dwelling investment, and prospects are for some increase in business investment outside the resources sector over the next year,"" the central bank said in a statement. ""These developments, some of which have been assisted by the reductions in interest rates that began 18 months ago, will all be helpful in sustaining growth."" Australia's economic growth in recent years has been fuelled by the growing demand for its commodities, such as iron ore. That resulted in a resources boom in Australia and helped it sustain growth through the global financial crisis. However, as demand from key markets such as China has eased, there have been concerns that Australia's mining sector may see its growth slow. At the same time, many analysts have pointed out that other areas of the country's economy have not done so well, resulting in what many have termed a two-speed economy. To make matters worse, the Australian currency has strengthened - making its exports more expensive, as well as affecting sectors such as manufacturing and tourism. It rose nearly 9% against the US dollar between June 2012 and April 2013. Amid all these concerns, there have been calls for policymakers to take steps to help boost growth, especially in the non-mining sectors, to ensure that the economy continues to grow. Analysts said the cut in interest rates, which will help bring down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, will help to provide some relief to those sectors and allay fears of an economic slowdown. ""Commodity prices have fallen and inflation has come in less than expected, and of course the Australian dollar through all of that has remained surprisingly strong,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist with AMP Capital Investors. ""I think it was appropriate for the Reserve to provide a bit more confidence [so that] when the mining investment boom starts to wane the rest of the economy will fill the gap.""

Spieth began the day 10 shots behind Kisner, but carded nine birdies to move three adrift of his fellow American, who had his first bogeys of the week. On a day when play was delayed because of the weather, the final group of Knox, Kisner and Branden Grace were asked on the 18th tee if they wanted to play the hole.

"It is unclear who stopped the landing but a source close to President Ashraf Ghani told the BBC the return had not been co-ordinated with the government. Gen Dostum left for Turkey in May amid claims he ordered his men to kidnap, beat and rape a political rival. He denies wrongdoing. His spokesman said he went for a medical check-up. Atta Mohammad Noor, the powerful governor of northern Balkh province, was waiting at Mazar-e Sharif airport to meet Gen Dostum on Monday night, the Pajhwok news agency reported. More than 1,000 people accompanied the governor to receive the former warlord at the airport, which is near his home province of Jowzjan. Witnesses said some Dostum supporters held posters with slogans such as ""Welcome back our dear leader,"" Reuters news agency reported. But the plane was diverted to Ashgabat in Turkmenistan. Early reports suggested German forces were behind the move. However, Nato later denied this, saying such decisions were a matter for the Afghan authorities. A source close to President Ghani told the BBC's Afghan service that Gen Dostum's decision to return without consulting the authorities in Kabul had caused suspicion. ""We wanted him to come to Kabul... because we wanted to have a clear understanding of what's going on,"" the source said. ""There are no legal hurdles for him to return, the government has no issues, but he has to take the right route."" Gen Dostum, Atta Mohammad and Mohammad Mohaqeq, another influential ethnic leader, recently formed an opposition group calling for major political reforms. They want to trim the powers of the president, whom they accuse of accumulating power. Gen Dostum's officials have denied he was on the plane that was turned away. But one of the men tasked with preparing for his return confirmed to the BBC that Gen Dostum had spoken with his men from Ankara on Monday morning. He had directed them to co-ordinate with Atta Mohammad and Mohammad Mohaqeq and to organise a major event to launch the new coalition. The vice-president is a former warlord with decades of experience in Afghanistan's turbulent political arena. He has been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in the country's long-running civil war, but joined its national unity government in 2014. The allegations against him come from Ahmad Eshchi, a former ally, who says he suffered days of severe beatings and sexual abuse at Gen Dostum's command. He said the vice-president and 10 other men assaulted him while he was forcibly kept at Gen Dostum's residence in November 2016. The ex-warlord denies the claims and has said that Mr Eshchi was detained by the country's intelligence service.

The man, who was referred to as ""C"", had killed his ex-girlfriend and her new companion, the court heard. Anonymity was ""necessary"" for his reintegration into the community, the judges ruled. The anonymity issue came about after C, who was released in October, applied for a High Court judicial review of a decision by the home secretary to refuse him unescorted leave in the community. Stephen Knafler QC, appearing for C, accepted that his crimes were ""high up on the scale of horrific"". But he said legal challenges involving mental health patients should be held in private - or at least with the individual's identity protected. Lady Hale, the court's deputy president, described C's crimes as ""horrendous"" and said they had caused ""incalculable distress to the families of the victims"". But she said that without anonymity there was ""a very real risk that the progress he has made during his long years of treatment in hospital would be put in jeopardy and his reintegration in the community, which was an important purpose of his transfer to hospital, will not succeed"". ""I would therefore allow this appeal and maintain the anonymity order in place,"" she said. She also said the public had a right to know what happened in the courts, and that sensible decisions were being made. But that ""right to know"" had to be balanced against the potential harm the disclosure of a patient's identity could cause to the patient ""and perhaps also to the hospital, those treating him and other patients"". The court judgement says the Parole Board agreed to the release of the man on life licence in September and had imposed a number of conditions. One of the conditions was that C continues to have psychiatric treatment.","A ""horrendous"" killer who was refused unescorted leave in the community can be named, the Court of Appeal has ruled.","['The summary is not correct because it incorrectly states that the man can be named, but the source text says that the court ruled to keep the anonymity order in place.', 'The summary states that the Court of Appeal made the ruling, but the text does not mention the Court of Appeal; it refers to a High Court judicial review and judges, but not the Court of Appeal.']",[],0
"The South American country qualified for the event by winning the Division Six tournament in Essex last September, when they beat Guernsey in the final. But the International Cricket Council launched an investigation after eligibility issues came to light. They will be replaced by Vanuatu, who finished third in Division Six. The World Cricket League is the ICC's one-day tournament for non Test-playing nations, which offers them the chance of qualifying for the World Cup. ""The Surinaamse Cricket Bond (SCB) has now accepted that it failed in its duty to ensure the provision of accurate residency information in respect of a number of players,"" the ICC said in a statement. Suriname has also been relegated to the World Cricket League's Americas Division One and forfeited a $25,000 grant received for the tournament in Jersey, which takes place from 21 to 28 May. ""We were obviously disappointed by the shortcomings in the SCB's procedures that were revealed by our investigation,"" said Tim Anderson, the ICC's head of global development. ""There is inevitably an element of self-certification when it comes to determining compliance with the player eligibility regulations, and for this reason the wider cricketing community needs to be able to place the utmost trust in the accuracy of information submitted by other ICC members.

"Figures show about 57% of closures since September 2006 were in the nine more rural council areas. Conservative education spokesman Darren Millar said Labour was ""letting down"" rural communities with a ""grim record"". Ministers said they were developing plans to ensure rural schools were not ""adversely affected by an over emphasis on surplus places"". Earlier in July, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams told BBC Wales a new law to support rural education could be introduced. An agreement between the Liberal Democrat AM and the Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones included a pledge to look at the impact of current policy on rural schools. According to figures obtained by Mr Millar, using a written question to Ms Williams, 89 out of 157 school closures between the academic years 2006-07 and 2015-16 were in the nine predominantly-rural council areas. Ceredigion shut 20 schools over the period, Powys 18 and Carmarthenshire 17. Mr Millar said: ""It is a scandal that your school is more likely to close if you live in a rural community than if you live in an urban one. ""It's vital that rural Wales gets a better deal from the Welsh Labour-led government in the future and that alternatives to closure, such as schools working together to share staff and resources, are given the chance to work before closure is considered."" Ms Williams, AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, secured a place in Mr Jones's Labour cabinet based on an agreement which included a promise to review current policy on surplus school places ""with emphasis on rural schools"". Responding to Mr Millar's comments she said ministers were ""committed to reviewing the current policy on surplus school places, with an emphasis on rural schools"". ""This is an opportunity for us to look at the impact of the policy and what that means on the ground in rural areas about the future of education provision. ""We are developing proposals on how we can ensure that schools in rural Wales are not adversely affected by an over emphasis on surplus places.""

"Saintfiet said Adebayor and two other Togo players - Kossi Agassa and Floyd Ayite - had shown a lack of discipline after they failed to join up with the squad on time as they prepared for their opening Africa Cup of Nations qualifier next weekend. ""I have no problem with the players as individuals,"" Saintfiet told BBC Sport from Accra. At the moment they are not part of it, but they have not been suspended and I have no problem with them. The doors are never closed for me because these are players with exceptional quality . ""It's their choice not to come to the hotel, not to be part of the group, and that makes the choice for me very easy to say these players are now not able to be part of the national team. ""We ask only to be as one team together, to prepare us for these important games,"" Saintfiet explained. Togo take on Liberia in Lome on Sunday 14 June in a Group A fixture that marks the start of their qualifying campaign for the 2017 Nations Cup finals. The fixture against Ghana on Monday will be a big test for Togo against the recent Nations Cup runners-up as they prepare for the Liberia game. The absence of Tottenham striker Adebayor, Stade de Reims goalkeeper Agassa and Bastia midfielder Ayite will be a big loss for Togo but Saintfiet claims he was left with little choice saying all three players were absent for much of last week. ""Floyd Ayite and [Kossi] Agassa were only one time in training and Emmanuel [Adebayor] came twice, but for the rest of the time I never saw him. ""So I'm very sad about that because these three players were in my squad of 23, they are important players for the country and I was looking forward to working with them. ""But if they are not able to be part of it and commit to the national team as all the other players - and we have many more players who play in Europe - the rules are the same for everyone."" Despite removing all three players from the squad, Saintfiet - who previously coached Ethiopia, Namibia and Malawi - insists the trio have not been suspended and could still have a future with Togo. ""At the moment they are not part of it, but they have not been suspended and I have no problem with them. The doors are never closed for me because these are players with exceptional quality. Adebayor's club Tottenham Hotspur gave him compassionate leave twice last season to return to Africa to deal with a personal family feud that the striker has discussed on social media. Saintfiet , who was appointed last month as coach of the west African nation, acknowledged Adebayor's importance to the Togo set-up.

"In its interim report, the commission also said there was not enough evidence to support widespread rape allegations. It did not mention claims that security forces had been killing people. There have been repeated allegations of abuses of Rohingya people since a military counter-insurgency campaign was launched in Rakhine in October. Some have even said the state's actions amount to ethnic cleansing, and Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, has faced international criticism. Who will help Myanmar's Rohingya? Nobel laureates urge action on Rohingya . The commission, set up by the Myanmar government and led by a former general, Myint Swe, is due to make its final conclusions before the end of January. But, in its interim findings, it dismissed allegations of genocide on the basis that there are still Rohingya Muslims living in Rakhine and that Islamic religious buildings have not been destroyed. It said it had so far found ""insufficient evidence"" that anyone had been raped by security forces, despite widespread claims. Accusations of arson, arbitrary arrest and torture are still being investigated. Strangely, the commission made no mention of the most serious claim - that Burmese security forces have been killing civilians as collective punishment for attacks by Rohingya militants, the BBC's Myanmar correspondent Jonah Fisher reports. Three months since this crisis began, little progress appears to have been made to solve it, he notes. The report says hundreds of Rohingya have been arrested but armed militants are still moving around easily and that looted weapons have yet to be recovered. Earlier in the week, several police were detained after a video surfaced appearing to show officers beating Rohingya Muslims during a security operation in November. The admission that security forces may have carried out abuses is an unusual development, as leaders have previously insisted they are following the rule of law. Rakhine state is closed to journalists and investigators, making it difficult to independently verify any allegations. The estimated one million Muslim Rohingya are seen by many in mainly Buddhist Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. They are denied citizenship by the government despite tracing their ancestry back generations. Communal violence in Rakhine state in 2012 left scores dead and displaced more than 100,000 people, with many Rohingya still remaining in decrepit camps. They face widespread discrimination and mistreatment. Hundreds of thousands of undocumented Rohingya are estimated to live in Bangladesh, having fled Myanmar over decades. Bangladesh says around 50,000 Rohingya have crossed its border over the past two months. The situation has drawn global condemnation.

"Electronics giant Sony, as well as automakers Honda and Toyota cited damage at their plants. The quakes killed at least 41 people and have caused severe destruction to buildings and infrastructure. The suspensions in Kumamoto, a manufacturing hub, could cause supply chain disruptions. Chipmaker Renesas Electronics also said there had been damage to some equipment at its Kumamoto plant, which produces micro-controller chips for cars. Toyota said it would suspend operations at most assembly plants across Japan. The suspension across Toyota's facilities will be done in stages, and will last for about a week. The world's biggest car manufacturer said it had been unable to source parts from some of its suppliers. This includes its affiliate Aisin Seiki which is a key supplier for Toyota. Japan's Nikkei newspaper has reported that Aisin Seiki has been forced to stop producing doors, engines and other parts at its subsidiary in the Kumamoto prefecture, as the area is still experiencing aftershocks. The company is making plans to shift production to other facilities at home and abroad. The staggered suspension across Toyota's plants is expected to lead to a drop in production, by about 50,000 vehicles, the Nikkei said citing industry analysts.

"Mohammed Haji Sadiq taught for 30 years at Cardiff's Madina mosque and abused four girls as a form of punishment. He was found guilty of eight sexual assaults on a child under 13 by touching, and six indecent assaults after a trial at Cardiff Crown Court. The court heard Sadiq, of Cyncoed, ""took advantage of his position"". He had denied the charges involving four girls aged between five and 11 and blamed ""politics"" in the mosque for the accusations. But sentencing him, Judge Stephen Hopkins QC told Sadiq: ""Children called you 'uncle' as a mark of respect. You are a man in my judgement of some cunning."" He added: ""Beneath the veneer there is a dark and deviant side."" Sadiq, who was a part-time Imam, sexually assaulted two girls under the age of 13 by touching, and indecently assaulted two other girls over a decade between 1996 and 2006 at the Woodville Road mosque. He abused them if they made a mistake while reciting the Koran and would use a stick as a form of punishment in class, hitting people over the hand or hard on the back. Some of his victims said they were afraid to attend the mosque because of his abuse. One said she had attempted to take her own life because of the abuse. In victim impact statements read to the court, others said they felt they could not tell anyone about the abuse because of the culture they grew up in. The court heard one victim feared the consequences of speaking out following Sadiq's conviction. She said: ""Due to my religion it was very difficult, almost impossible to tell anyone what had happened"". She added: ""In the Muslim religion we do not talk about personal matters"". Another victim said it was ""not acceptable"" in her culture to talk about what was happening at the mosque. She said: ""I remember the relief I felt when I told my mother, and she believed me and went to the police. ""In my family honour is very important, but my family have been very supportive"". Sadiq has had no involvement in the mosque since 2006 when it burnt down and was re-sited elsewhere in the city. He was cleared of one indecent assault after his trial last month. In addition to his jail sentence, he was issued with a sexual harm prevention order and will have to register as a sex offender. Det Ch Insp Rob Cronick of South Wales Police praised the ""immense courage"" of the victims who came forward.

"Coach Eddie Jones announced at the launch of the championship that the 30-year-old will continue in the role. ""I haven't actually told him... shall I say now? I'd like to announce Dylan's the captain,"" Jones said. Hartley, who led England to the Grand Slam last year, was banned for hitting Leinster's Sean O'Brien in December. He caught the Irish flanker high with a swinging arm during Northampton's 37-10 Champions Cup loss and was shown the third red card of his career. The subsequent suspension took the total number of weeks he has been unavailable during his career to 60. Hartley will not have played for nine weeks before England's opening game against France on 4 February at Twickenham. When the captain was asked if he had changed his game in response to his latest sanction, Jones interrupted: ""He's had 60 weeks off mate, he's a world expert."" The Australian added: ""I think he's ready. He trained well on Tuesday and has still got a couple of days to go. We're pleased to have him back. It's the continuity of the job.""

Hartley was dropped from England's 2015 Rugby World Cup squad after he headbutted Saracens' Jamie George, but was recalled by Jones after he replaced Stuart Lancaster. The hooker went on to lead the side to a Six Nations Grand Slam as they embarked on a run of 14 consecutive Test match victories. British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland has refused to be drawn on whether Hartley's disciplinary record will affect his chances of leading this summer's tour to New Zealand.

"Juliano Pinto, a 29-year-old with complete paralysis of the lower trunk, performed the symbolic kick-off at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo. Using his robotic suit, Mr Pinto kicked the official ball a short distance along a mat laid down by the touchline. But some observers argued the historic event was not given the attention it deserved during the opening ceremony. The identity of the young volunteer was kept a secret until after the event. His robotic exoskeleton was created by a team of more than 150 researchers led by Brazilian neuroscientist Dr Miguel Nicolelis. Dr Nicolelis tweeted called the event a ""great team effort"" and afterwards tweeted: ""We did it!!!"" ""It was up to Juliano to wear the exoskeleton, but all of them made that shot. It was a big score by these people and by our science,"" he commented. The neuroscientist, who is based at Duke University in the US, is a leading figure in the field of brain-machine interfaces. In breakthrough work published in 2003, he showed that monkeys could control the movement of virtual arms on an avatar using just their brain activity. The scientists have been working under the banner of a consortium called the Walk Again Project. In a statement, the consortium said the World Cup demonstration would be ""just the beginning"" of a future ""in which people with paralysis may abandon the wheelchair and literally walk again"".

""Doing a demonstration in a stadium is something very much outside our routine in robotics. It's never been done before."" The exoskeleton uses a cap placed on the patient's head to pick up brain signals and relay them to a computer in the exoskeleton's backpack. This then decodes the signals and sends them to the legs. The robotic suit is powered by hydraulics, and a battery in the backpack allows for approximately two hours of use. ""The basic idea is that we are recording from the brain and then that signal is being translated into commands for the robot to start moving,"" Dr Gordon Cheng, at the Technical University of Munich, who is a member of the team, told the BBC in May. Dr Cheng led the development of a form of artificial skin for the exoskeleton. This skin consists of flexible printed circuit boards, each containing pressure, temperature and speed sensors. It is applied on the soles of the feet and allows the patient to receive tactile stimulation when walking with the exoskeleton. When the robotic suit starts to move and touches the ground, signals are transmitted to an electronic vibration device on the patient's arm, which stimulates their skin. After lots of practice, the brain starts associating the movements of the legs with the vibration in the arm. In theory, the patient should start to develop the sensation that they have legs and that they are walking. The suit has been named Bra-Santos Dumont, which combines the three-letter designation for Brazil and Alberto Santos-Dumont, the aviation pioneer who was born in the country's southern state of Minas Gerais.",A paralysed Brazilian man has kicked a football during the opening ceremony of the 2014 Fifa World Cup.,"['The summary makes up his nationality, ', 'The summary makes up the year of the World Cup']",,0

"On Friday, we saw signs of what shape such a shift may take. In a post on the platform he runs, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman suggested the technology industry - and the complex spider's web of relationships within it - needs to agree on what he's called a Decency Pledge, a code of conduct most would consider to just be responsible, professional behaviour, but in the technology business apparently needs to be hammered home. Mr Hoffman's post - which I'll go into more detail about in a moment - followed a damning report published on Thursday by The Information - a subscription-only tech news service. It shared details alleging several instances of sexual harassment by a prominent venture capitalist, Justin Caldbeck, who by Friday afternoon had taken a leave of absence from Binary Capital, where he is/was a managing partner. The Information quoted several women, some of whom chose to make their identities public - a stance not often taken in this industry, but one buoyed by the efforts of Susan Fowler, the former Uber employee who blogged about her treatment at the firm, kicking off Uber's torrid phase. From the report: ""The women who made the allegations include Niniane Wang, who co-created Google Desktop and served as CTO of Minted, and Susan Ho and Leiti Hsu, co-founders of Journy, a travel planning and booking service. ""Ms Wang alleges Mr Caldbeck, while informally trying to recruit her for a tech company job, tried to sleep with her. ""Ms Ho said that Mr Caldbeck, while discussing investing in their start-up, sent her text messages in the middle of the night suggesting they meet up. Ms Hsu says that Mr Caldbeck groped her under a table at a Manhattan hotel bar."" Mr Caldbeck responded to the allegations on Friday afternoon. ""The past 24 hours have been the darkest of my life,"" he said in a statement first reported by Axios. ""I have made many mistakes over the course of my career, some of which were brought to light this week. To say I'm sorry about my behaviour is a categorical understatement. Still, I need to say it: I am so, so sorry."" He said he apologised for contributing to a ""gender hostile"" environment. ""The power dynamic that exists in venture capital is despicably unfair,"" he continued. ""The gap of influence between male venture capitalists and female entrepreneurs is frightening and I hate that my behaviour played a role in perpetrating a gender-hostile environment. It is outrageous and unethical for any person to leverage a position of power in exchange for sexual gain, it is clear to me now that that is exactly what I've done."" Unlike Uber, a service used by millions around the world, the allegations against Mr Caldbeck will not generate many headlines. While well-known among the movers of Silicon Valley, like many big-time investors here, Mr Caldbeck operates in a world the majority of the public don't get to see. But the ramifications of this fall from grace, coming as it does so soon after the Uber scandal, point to a bigger picture in which those previously worried to speak out are deciding that it's a risk worth taking. But LinkedIn's Mr Hoffman points out that preventing abuses of power between investors and those eager for their money - but not sexual advances - is difficult. Unlike a manager-employee relationship within a company, where good firms can use thorough HR measures to prevent abuse, these are interactions happening between people from separate firms, and one where the balance of power is tipped heavily in one direction. In other words, there is no way to ""refer up"" a complaint - other than going to the press, a terrifying and potentially career-limiting approach. ""I think the industry should actively work on building a kind of industry-wide HR function,"" Mr Hoffman writes. ""So that venture capitalists who engage in such behaviour face the same sort of consequences that they would if their overtures were directed at an employee."" ___________ .

"Nicholas Edwards wrote to her in 1985 to complain about plans to cut the budget for regional development grants. The money was widely used to attract investment and jobs to Wales. The archives also show UK Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the Barnett formula, a political issue to this day. In the mid-1980s, Wales secured one fifth of inward investment into the UK despite having only 5% of the population.

Peter Rees, later Lord Rees of Goytre, wrote to Mrs Thatcher: ""Even our predecessors never saw it as any more than a stop-gap arrangement on the road to political devolution, certainly not as the permanency it has now become. ""Be that as it may, the block system is now publicly construed, in the territories, as apolitical entitlement to public expenditure. The longer we let it run the harder it becomes to challenge that perception, and the greater the risk of political repercussion when we do. "" MP David Willetts, then a Downing Street adviser, wrote: ""Scotland and NI have their snouts well and truly in the public expenditure trough. The challenge is to find a politically acceptable way of putting them on the same diet as the English."" The files reveal that the Treasury considered suspending the formula. Mr Rees wrote to Mrs Thatcher: ""The 'fallback' approach to securing savings is to suspend the operation of the comparability formulae for the Scottish and Northern Ireland blocks - though not for Wales, where over-provision is not suspected."" Thirty years on, the UK political parties have vowed to keep the formula as part of a deal to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom. Mrs Thatcher's ministers considered launching the controversial poll tax in Wales before England, according to other files just released. The documents released by the National Archives also show Conservative government advisers feared a repeat of the 1984-85 miners' strike the following winter. They also revealed there were plans to hide art treasures in underground tunnels in the Rhydymwyn Valley works, near Mold, if a civil or nuclear emergency arose during the 1980s.","Margaret Thatcher was warned that cuts to Welsh government spending would be ""most damaging"", newly released papers reveal.",['The summary attributes Thatcher as the primary recipient of the warning when it was Rees'],,0

"The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) wants to replace the lifeboat building on South Marine Drive in Bridlington with a new one 500m away on Spa Promenade. The RNLI said the 1903 building was ""cramped and outdated"". East Riding of Yorkshire Council will decide whether to pass the plans on 8 January. The council had previously agreed the promenade south of Bridlington Spa could be widened by up to seven metres so the current lifeboat can be launched more safely and effectively. Michael Oakes, of the RNLI, said the new site, which is between Bridlington Spa and the pumping station, would mean all the lifesaving equipment could be kept together in one place instead of the inshore lifeboat and equipment being kept a short walk away in a separate building on Princess Mary Promenade. Mr Oakes said it would also mean quicker launch times because the lifeboat would not need to cross the road and the Shannon-class lifeboat, which is due to replace the current Mersey all-weather lifeboat by 2018, could be kept inside coupled with its launch vehicle. Plans for the two-storey building include public viewing areas, a mechanic station and a shop, as well as improved changing and equipment facilities.

Terry met Chelsea fan Tommi last year, and when he was told of the boy's death he volunteered to pay for the service. Tommi was laid to rest near his Cambridge home in a Chelsea-blue casket bearing the club logo. Tommi, who was diagnosed with leukaemia aged three, died last month after a bone marrow transplant proved unsuccessful. More on this and other stories from Cambridgeshire . Family friend Tawney Bianca Toogood contacted Terry on Instagram to tell him the boy he had been photographed with had died. When she explained the family could not afford the funeral they wanted for their son, the former England captain got in touch with the funeral parlour and covered the full Â£1,600 costs. Tommi's mother Ruth said she was ""overwhelmed"" by the gesture and ""very proud"" the footballer - one of her son's favourite players - remembered him. Most of the arrangements for Tommi's funeral were made by Mrs Toogood's mother Mally Beaver, and sister Chelsea. The families became friends after meeting on the cancer ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

The paper has seen a leaked document detailing a proposal submitted to the political talks process aimed at restoring the Northern Ireland executive. The suggestion from the chief executive of the Ulster-Scots Agency, Ian Crozier, to the head of languages at the Department of Communities, proposes an additional Â£140m in funding for Ulster-Scots culture. Mr Crozier is a former special adviser to DUP MP Nigel Dodds and remains a member of the party, according to the News Letter. His paper outlined his belief that ""the Ulster-Scots community is facing discrimination"" and that the Irish language receives 10 times more funding than all Ulster-Scots culture combined. Staying with politics, the News Letter reports that the DUP South Antrim MP Sammy Wilson is ""fed up"" with MLAs ""gurning"", which is, incidentally, Ulster-Scots for complaining. His remarks come as a complaint against his DUP colleague Edwin Poots for allegedly breaching the Northern Ireland assembly's code of conduct was dismissed.

He has now passed the 50 mark in all five matches he has played in the competition. He received admirable support from the tail, sharing stands of 43 with Andrew McBrine (18) for the eighth wicket and 41 for the last with Peter Chase (18) as Ireland added 91 to their overnight total. The determination with which the Irish tail had resisted Afghanistan and leg-spinner Rashid Khan - who failed to add to his five-wicket tally - offered hope the Irish could mount a spirited resistance with the bat.

But with inflation standing at 2.6%, real earnings still fell by 0.5%, the ONS figures showed.

Pay rises improved, up by 2.1% (excluding bonuses) compared with a consensus prediction of 2%. The increase prompted some economists to suggest that wages may finally be responding to an economy which is closing in on full employment. It remains, however, a long way short of what would be required to trigger the sort of wage-price spiral about which central bankers have been hyper-vigilant since the 1970s. That employees are prepared to accept wages that shrink by a tiny bit less than they did the last time these figures came out does not exactly bespeak a dramatic new assertion of workers' bargaining power. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics said the figures gave some signs that the tighter labour market was leading to a recovery in wage growth. ""Inflation is likely to fall back next year as the impact of the drop in the pound dwindles. What's more, the tightness of the labour market should deliver further rises in nominal wage growth over the coming quarters,"" she said.

He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was ""an inexhaustible store"" of Winston Churchill quotes. Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic. His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration. He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home. Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings. He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. ""All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,"" he wrote. In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that ""American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom"". He said they keep ""relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda"". Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage. His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge ""in the mould"" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority. Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores v Sebelius case. Judge Gorsuch has also expressed concern about ""executive overreach"", a criticism that was often directed at the Obama administration's use of presidential orders to overcome congressional gridlock. He has sharply questioned a landmark Supreme Court ruling determining that courts should defer to government agencies when it comes to interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. Conservatives blame the 1984 decision involving the Chevron oil company for handing too much power to the regulatory state. In an August 2016 concurring opinion, Judge Gorsuch wrote that ""executive bureaucracies [were being allowed] to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design"". In a 2013 case, he upheld a lower court's ruling that a police officer was protected under qualified-immunity law after he used a stun gun on a 22-year-old student, who died from the incident.",Neil Gorsuch has been nominated by President Donald Trump to the US Supreme Court.,"['the first name of Trump is added to the summary and is not found in the source text', 'The first name of Gorsuch is added to the summary and is not found in the source text', 'The source does not explicitly state the fact that Trump is President.']","['The summary states that Neil Gorsuch was nominated by President Donald Trump, but the text does not mention who nominated him.']",0

"David McIlveen, who is still a member of the party, said Mrs Foster had ""seriously misjudged"" public anger. Mrs Foster set up the RHI scheme in 2012, but its lack of cost controls has left NI taxpayers with a Â£490m bill. A DUP spokesperson said she continued to receive ""overwhelming support"" within the party and beyond. ""Former MLA David McIlveen is entitled to his personal opinions, however, this is the first time that he has articulated any view since losing his seat,"" they said. On Wednesday, the party said the assembly may be recalled next week to approve emergency legislation to deal with the overspend. Mr McIlveen, who is the son of Free Presbyterian minister and close friend of the late Rev Ian Paisley, Rev David McIlveen, questioned Mrs Foster's handling of RHI in an article for the News Letter. He suggested Mrs Foster was personally responsible for turning the scheme into an ""omnishambles"" and said she will come under increased pressure from her own party. He drew comparisons with the treatment of former DUP leaders Peter Robinson and the Rev Ian Paisley. Mr McIlveen wrote that Mrs Foster was now ""deeply damaged"" and unlikely to lead the party into the next election after becoming an ""electoral liability"". ""Does a party obsessed with elections want to move forward with a leader who appears incapable of facing up to their mistakes?"" he asked. ""The RHI scandal was most likely driven more by a desire to curry favour with the rural electorate than anything more sinister. ""Whilst the view in public is that Arlene's team are as loyal and happy as ever, the reality in private is something very different."" The party's East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson dismissed Mr McIlveen's comments. He asked what was more credible: ""The views of one individual who will have his own motivations, or the views of the vast majority of party members who have publicly come out and given their support to Arlene Foster. ""I think that I am maybe in a better position than David McIlveen to make an assessment of the view within the party."" However, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said Mr McIlveen's intervention was ""significant"". ""I know you were reporting it as David McIlveen breaking ranks and that is true, but equally true is that he is joining the ranks of those pointing the finger of blame,"" he said. ""And we're not talking about bit players here, David McIlveen was an assembly private secretary for Arlene Foster, he's joining Jonathan Bell who was a junior minister and also a minister for the department of enterprise."" Mr McIlveen also criticised Mrs Foster's treatment of Jonathan Bell, who in December, made a series of allegations about the DUP's involvement in the scheme. ""When one of her own party members broke rank to express their concern about the scheme, rather than approach the issues raised with a listening ear, the default position was to attack the personal integrity of the individual raising the concerns,"" he wrote. ""In any other context, Jonathan Bell MLA would be called a whistleblower. ""Upon witnessing the way in which he was treated by the leadership of the party I do not see how any member of the public who sees something going wrong in the civil service would feel inspired to raise issues with a DUP-run department, upon witnessing how their own people are treated."" Last month, Mrs Foster said she had ""felt intimidated by Jonathan Bell"" during an RHI meeting, claiming he had ""used his physical bulk to stand over me in quite an aggressive way"". Mr Bell had claimed that Mrs Foster was verbally ""abusive"" and angrily ""overruled"" him when he tried to close the scheme. Mr McIlveen also criticised Mrs Foster for branding some of her RHI critics as ""misogynist"", saying that ""rather than facing critics on the level of their political arguments yet again it descends to the personal"".

"The matter will be discussed at the International Football Association Board (Ifab) annual meeting at Wembley. Ifab are keen to reach a decision in principle at Friday's gathering. ""The captain should be more than somebody who has a piece of material on their arm,"" Ifab technical director David Elleray told BBC Sport. ""Can we consult them more about how the game should be played? Should we encourage much better relationships between the captains and players? Should the captain also bear more responsibility?"" Former Premier League referee Elleray believes the measures may stop players crowding around referees, as only the captain would have the authority to talk to officials after what he describes as ""major incidents"". ""If that stops six players from each team going to talk the referee that will enhance respect and improve respect for the game,"" he said. ""When I was refereeing, sometimes you could say to a captain 'have a word with Freddy because he's getting quite close to a yellow card' and he could calm him down. ""You could explain decisions to a good captain and he could pass that on."" Elleray confirmed that discussions have already taken place with an expert panel of players, coaches and referees and that there is widespread support for the plans. Other items on the agenda include a proposal to introduce sin-bins for yellow-card offences. The measure has been tested in Uefa development competitions and some amateur leagues in recent years. If approved, sin-bins will come in at youth and amateur levels and could be introduced to the professional game within two to three years. Ifab will also talk about allowing national associations more freedom to decide on the number of substitutions in a game. The move is intended to help the development of the game at lower levels, ""by promoting and encouraging more people to take part"".

"The first group stages of the women's tournament take place on Wednesday - so-called day -2 - with Sweden facing South Africa, while the men's group stages start on Thursday, when Iraq play Denmark (both 17:00 BST). Here's all you need to know. It's simply for scheduling reasons, as it was at London 2012. With 16 men's and 12 women's teams, there are 58 matches to get through. There is football being played on 12 days of the tournament, with six rest days. Men's groups . Women's groups . Barcelona forward Neymar will captain a Brazil squad aiming to win its first Olympic gold medal. The hosts also have Lazio midfielder Felipe Anderson in their squad along with Neymar's Barca team-mate Rafinha and Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos. Meanwhile, Tottenham forward Son Heung-min will represent South Korea and Chelsea's John Mikel Obi brings experience for Nigeria. Five-time women's world player of the year Marta competes in her fourth Olympics for Brazil, while her 38-year-old team-mate Formiga is going to her sixth Games and is looking to continue her streak of appearing at every women's Olympic football tournament. The reigning world and Olympic champions USA have seven gold medal winners in their line-up. Among them is goalkeeper Hope Solo, who could win a record fourth Olympic title at Rio, and current world player of the year Carli Lloyd. Team GB fielded men's and women's teams at London 2012, with both sides knocked out at the quarter-final stage. The English Football Association had hoped to have both teams in Rio, but they failed to gain support from the other home nations and Fifa was not willing to accept a Great Britain team without players from every one of the home nations. Qualification is also based on tournament results and while England's women would have earned their place by finishing third at last year's World Cup, the men's failure to get past the group stage of the European Under-21 Championships would have denied them. Team GB qualification is based on England's results because the English FA is the national governing body on the BOA. ""I'm really disappointed that these next set of players won't have that opportunity in Rio,"" said former England striker Kelly Smith, who was part of Team GB's 18-strong squad at London. ""It's a great experience and you get to play against the best teams and players from across the world. It's disheartening they couldn't get a side together. The Americans view this as the ultimate."" Even though it was not included in the Olympic programme until 1996, the women's competition is often seen as more prestigious than the men's, which is age-restricted (only three men in each squad can be over 23). For many Brazilians, the men's football tournament will be the most important part of the Games - especially on home soil, where they are looking to win their first ever gold medal in the sport. Hosts Brazil are the firm favourites to take the men's title after the disappointment of losing in the final at London 2012. Defending champions Mexico could prove a difficult opponent again, while Germany also have a strong team. In the women's event, the USA won gold in 2012 and the World Cup last year, while the European trio of France, Germany and Sweden will also be strong.

"Eric Hankin was one of 96 fans fatally injured in a terrace crush at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989. He and his group had tried to find a vantage point in the Leppings Lane end of the stadium, the jury heard. Timothy Lyons said he earlier warned Mr Hankin he would not be standing in the same area due to a previous experience. Mr Lyons said in a statement that he saw Mr Hankin, a 33-year-old nurse and father-of-two, inside the Sheffield stadium before the Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest tie. He said: ""Whilst I was waiting for my wife, I saw Eric Hankin come out of the men's toilet and he came over to talk to me. ""I told him that I would not be going into the central pens, especially after what I had experienced the previous year. ""I told him that my wife and I would be going into pen seven. ""Eric Hankin told me he was going to go behind the goal. It was a short conversation and I do not recall seeing Eric with anyone else."" Mr Hankin worked as a staff nurse at Moss Side Hospital in Maghull, Merseyside. Stephen Brown, who also worked at the hospital and went to the match with Mr Hankin, described going into pen three. He said: ""Our intention would have been to try to find a vantage point to watch the game, but any plans we had for that were gone as soon as we got in to the crowd and it was just chaos in there."" In his 1989 statement, Mr Brown described how the crush became worse and he saw a man near him fall to the ground with his eyes closed. He told the court: ""It was different waves of pressure, because you would move in one direction and you would get caught in an area. ""The pressure would build and there would be a crush that would increase, increase, increase, and then it would be released and you would move suddenly to the side, or forward, or backwards and then the same thing would happen. ""The crushing just increased, released, increased, released and some people were lucky enough to get out when the pressure released."" He said when the pressure was tight he was ""completely unable to draw breath"". The court saw a picture timed at about 15:02 BST, two minutes after the scheduled kick-off, which showed Mr Hankin towards the front of pen three. It is believed Mr Brown was also pictured to the right of his colleague. Mr Brown managed to escape through an open gate, the court heard. The jury also heard from two police officers, Richard Liversidge and Stephen Perry, who tried to revive Mr Hankin inside pen three after the crush. Mr Liversidge, who is now a detective inspector, said Mr Hankin was ""limp"" and ""not breathing"". The two officers tried to resuscitate him but were not successful. One of Mr Hankin's friends identified his body at 16:41 inside a temporary mortuary at the ground. His father, also named Eric Hankin, travelled to Sheffield to see his son's body the following day.

Veteran sailor Sir Robin Knox-Johnston is among those criticising the pair. The duo previously told BBC News they were experienced enough for the trip.

"The University of Glasgow's £32m Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) aims to bring clinical academics together with industry to improve patient care. It is the first time a 7 Tesla MRI scanner will be used in the UK in a clinical setting. It will be used to improve treatment for conditions such as stroke, vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The facility was built in collaboration with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GGC), with £16m of funding from the Medical Research Council and Glasgow City Region City Deal. The project is expected to bring 396 new jobs to the city over a seven year period, contributing about £88m to the local economy. The 7 Tesla MRI scanner was delivered to the site last November. A giant crane eased the 18-tonne device down an alleyway with inches to spare on each side, then through a hole in the wall of the new building. The building will also house the Clinical Innovation Zone to help biomedical companies improve healthcare technology through collaborative work. There willl be a further floor of neuro-operating theatres, which will be funded by the NHS GGC. Prof Dame Anna Dominiczak, of the College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, said it would be a ""world-leading"" example of a precision medicine centre. ""The ICE isn't about ivory tower research,"" she said. ""It is about bringing world-leading clinical academics together with industry to collaborate and to create something that not only positively benefits patients but also brings a meaningful economic benefit as well.""

"A 234-unit nursing home in Elkana, 30 houses in Beit Arye and 20 in Givat Zeev got the go-ahead on Tuesday. Retrospective permits were also issued for 179 existing homes in Ofarim. The US said it was ""deeply concerned"" and warned that settlement expansion posed a ""very serious and growing threat"" to peace with the Palestinians. About 570,000 Israelis live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Peace Now reported that the latest planning decision by the Israeli military-run Civil Administration in the West Bank meant 2,623 housing units at settlements had been approved so far this year. The figure includes 756 illegally-built homes that have been retrospectively ""legalised"". A senior US official told the AFP news agency that settlement expansion - as well as continuing demolitions of Palestinian homes - ""fundamentally undermines the prospects for a two-state solution and risks entrenching a one-state reality of perpetual occupation and conflict"". ""We are particularly troubled by the policy of retroactively approving illegal outposts and unauthorised settlement units,"" the official said. ""These policies have effectively given the government's green light for the pervasive advancement of settlement activity in a new and potentially unlimited way."" On Tuesday, Israel reacted angrily to similar criticism of its settlement activities by the UN special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov.

"Gen Mejia, 80, is accused of ordering massacres in indigenous Maya villages during Guatemala's 1960-96 civil war. His lawyers say he recently suffered a stroke and is not physically or mentally capable of answering the charges. Prosecutors dispute this, saying he was under sedation at an initial hearing. Oscar Mejia was arrested in Guatemala City earlier this month after a warrant was issued against him on charges of genocide. He ruled Guatemala from 1983-86 after seizing power in a coup. He also served as an army general and defence minister during the long civil war, in which an estimated 200,000 people were killed as the army battled left-wing guerrillas. A UN-backed truth commission found that the security forces were responsible for the vast majority of killings. It also concluded that massacres of indigenous Maya communities accused of supporting the rebels amounted to acts of genocide. Few senior army commanders have ever faced trial for the atrocities, but in recent months the government of President Alvaro Colom has begun to try to bring suspected war criminals to justice.

"Professional hunter Lee Lightsey said the 15 ft (4.5m) beast was one of the biggest he had come across in 18 years and required a tractor to move it. Mr Lightsey and hunting guide Blake Godwin discovered the alligator in cattle ponds while supervising a guided hunt on Saturday. When the creature surfaced about 20ft (6m) away from them, they shot it. ""Although this animal is huge I was not that surprised it existed,"" Mr Lightsey said. ""We have come across lots over the last 20 years that have been only a little smaller. ""But what really drew our attention to this animal was the fact that it seems to have been feasting on the cattle on my farm, because mutilated body parts were found in the water. It was a monster which needed to be removed."" Mr Lightsey's company arranges hunts for alligators, wild boar and turkey on the farm he owns for hunting trips. The largest alligator previously killed was just over 13ft (4m) long. He charges $10,000 (£7,060; €8,780) to kill an alligator larger than 13ft (4m) and $4,500 (£3,180; €3,955) to kill an alligator between 10ft and 12ft. The animals are mostly killed with a high-powered rifle. ""But always we kill them with the minimum of suffering without allowing them to be injured before they die,"" he said. There are hundreds of alligators for hunters between 10ft and 13ft, he says, while animals longer than 13ft are only encountered about once a year. Mr Lightsey has been commercially hunting alligators since he began ""harvesting"" them in 1988 and more than 5,000 alligators bigger than 1.5m have been killed since then. American alligators inhabit the south-east of the US with Florida and Louisiana each reported to have a population of more than one million alligators each. Southern Florida is reputed to be one of the only places in the world where both alligators and crocodiles live alongside each other in freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes and swamps.

"Trevor Timon, 31, hit 30-year-old Oliver Dearlove while the victim and his friends were talking to a group of women in Blackheath, south-east London, in August 2016. Timon admitted manslaughter but was cleared of murder at the Old Bailey. He was also given five years on extended licence as he was considered a ""significant risk"" to the public. Mr Dearlove died hours after the attack, which happened after he had struck up a friendly chat with the women, who had been out celebrating a birthday with Timon. How lives are devastated by a single blow . Timon demanded to know what they were discussing and told his victim ""if you don't get out of my face I will knock you out"", the court heard. He then punched Mr Dearlove in the side of the head with his left fist, sending him to the ground and knocking him out. A post-mortem examination found he died from bleeding to the brain. Judge Mark Dennis QC told Timon, who had a history of violence, Mr Dearlove had presented no threat and the punch was an ""unprovoked and gratuitous act"". ""This was a senseless death that occurred as a result of an act borne out of a flaw in your character which in the past has seen you display unnecessary violent conduct to others when, for reasons best known to you, you have become annoyed or wound yourself up,"" he said. ""Oliver Dearlove was a young man of fine character with a long and promising future ahead of him. His loss in such senseless circumstances has, as the court has heard, caused untold misery for his family and those close to him."" ""Many lives have been turned upside down."" Speaking before the sentence was handed down, Mr Dearlove's girlfriend Claire Wheatley broke down in tears as she described her heartbreak at losing her ""Mr Right"". The nurse described him as the ""most gentle, kind and relaxed person I have ever known and a true gentleman which is why so many people liked him."" She said the couple had been making plans for the future before the ""dreaded knock on our door"". Miss Wheatley added: ""We are all familiar with the phrase 'a broken heart', but unless you have experienced some form of loss or sadness it is difficult to understand how this truly feels. ""On August 28 2016, I was unfortunate enough to learn its true meaning. ""The difference is my heart is not broken, it feels more like it has been obliterated."" Mr Dearlove's mother Joy Wright told the court: ""No parent should have to make the decision to switch off their child's life support. ""Timon may as well have used a gun or knife, the damage he did. He then just walked away casually without a thought or care for what he had done. ""I think of Oli every morning when I wake and dream of him in my sleep. I see him as a baby, a schoolboy and as the smashing young man he had become, such a gentle unassuming soul."" In a letter read to court, Timon said: ""There is not a single day that I don't think of Oliver, his friends and family and the devastating effects my action has caused."" Timon was convicted of battery after he admitted punching a woman in the face, allegedly knocking her out having previously threatened to ""bang"" her out.

"Federal prosecutors announced the charges as they listed a catalogue of alleged abuses. The Justice Department has been scrutinising Baltimore police after accusing it last August of systemic racism and abusing power. The officers ""arrogantly"" ignored clear directives, a police official said. Police Commissioner Kevin Davis condemned the officers at a news conference. ""These officers are 1930s-style gangsters,"" Mr Davis said. ""They betrayed the trust we're trying to build with our community at a very sensitive time in our history."" The seven officers are: Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Daniel Hersl, Sergeant Wayne Jenkins, Jemell Rayam, Marcus Taylor and Maurice Ward. Mr Gondo is also charged with participating in a drug conspiracy. All of the men were arrested, suspended without pay and jailed, pending detention hearings on Thursday. Federal prosecutors said the men began their criminal enterprise in 2015, after the city erupted into protest over the death of a young black man, Freddie Gray, while he was in police custody. The Justice Department later opened a ""pattern and practice"" investigation into the police force, finding that the department routinely discriminated against black people and used excessive force. Federal agents by then had spent months following officers on the Gun Trace Task Force, which was formed to crack down on violent crime by tracking illegal guns on the streets. Prosecutors accuse the men of committing robberies and filing false reports to conceal their crimes. In one instance, four of the officers arrested a man during a traffic stop and confiscated drugs as well as $21,500 (Â£17,516). The officers only submitted $15,000 as evidence, and then later went to the man's home and stole $200,000 and a $4,000 watch from a safe deposit box. In another incident, three of the officers stopped a man on the street, searched his car without a warrant and later took $1,500 he had earned working as a maintenance supervisor at a nursing home. The charges were announced a day after US Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggested that he might ease federal scrutiny of law enforcement across the country as it could undermine their policing ability. Baltimore was one of dozens of US cities to face a federal civil rights probe under the Obama administration. The city and the Justice Department had reached a court-enforceable consent decree in January requiring police to make sweeping changes to its practices. Mr Obama made police reform a priority in the wake of mounting racial tension and high-profile police shootings across the country. Baltimore police union president Gene Ryan said he was ""disturbed"" by the recent charges. DeRay Mckesson, a local Black Lives Matter activist, said the charges were disturbing but signalled reform. ""It is promising to see the beginning of accountability being applied to the Baltimore Police Department,"" he said.

The Antonov An-12 plane was heading to Paloch, Upper Nile State, and crashed 800m (half a mile) from the runway. In a statement, Ukraine-based Antonov said the plane had not been airworthy. It said the plane, which was built in 1971, ""was is no state to fly because it failed to undergo timely technical servicing... that should have included work on extending its resources and exploitation timeframe"", AFP news agency reported. South Sudan authorities warned that the death toll could rise as the debris was cleared. The plane crashed into a farming community on an island on the White Nile River but so far all the victims recovered were from the aircraft, the Red Cross said. Presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said all of the plane's passengers were from South Sudan. He said five of the six crew members were Armenian, while the sixth member was Russian. Armenia's foreign ministry has confirmed that five of its nationals were killed. The head of the Civil Aviation at Juba airport said emergency officials had secured the site of the crash and were ""in the stage of recovering bodies and black box [flight recorder]"". While the cause of the crash is still unclear, the presidential spokesman told a news conference that it might have been down to engine failure. Witnesses said bodies, debris and cargo were strewn over a wide area along the river bank. A man who saw the plane come down said he thought it might crash into a market area, but the pilot seemed to divert at the last minute. A local farmer described the moment the plane started to go down, telling AFP: ""The sound was so loud... the plane started descending and landed near my door. ""One of the tyres broke off and ran into the house - but thank God it did not injure anyone."" Cargo planes flying to remote parts of South Sudan often carry passengers too. The plane's first flight was in 1971, the Aviation Safety Network reported. It was being operated by Allied Services Limited, a logistics company based in South Sudan, at the time of the crash.

"It has also announced a 5.5bn Australian dollar ($4.4bn; Â£2.8bn) capital-raising effort which will involve the selling of new shares. NAB wants to demerge and float its troubled British bank, Clydesdale, and shore up its balance sheet. The lender is one of the country's big four and the largest by assets. NAB's preferred cash profit measure for the period, excluding some accounting items, met forecasts and came to $A3.32bn. Its half-year net profit came in at $A3.44bn, up 20.4%. The cash profit number strips out some one-off accounting items and is the bank's preferred measure of performance. NAB's capital-raising announcement has been reported by some of Australia's media as being the largest in the country's corporate history. The bank also announced Australia's former treasury secretary Ken Henry would take over as its chairman, replacing the long-serving Michael Chaney in December. The lender's shares will be suspended from trade on the Australian stock exchange as its book-building activities commence. NAB is the last of the country's big banks to report this week, together with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ and Westpac. Other results were mixed, with lenders missing and beating expectations. The so-called big four are regarded as highly profitable, however, the latest results have concerned investors, with many analysts referring to a so-called new era that could see Australian banks fail to return any more record profits. The big four lenders came out of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, but are now facing tighter regulatory controls. In a report published last year, Australian banks were told they needed to hold more capital to be able to survive future financial crises. The Financial System Inquiry report singled out bank competition, increased capital levels and inefficient taxes for reform. NAB's capital-raising effort is largely viewed as an attempt to get ahead of Australian regulators by further boosting its capital ratios.

"So why would a country like Zambia lift the ban on the shooting and killing of its precious lion and leopard populations? The answer is very clear - it is the need for foreign currency in order to fund sustainable wildlife programmes, which can be costly, and also to benefit local communities. Trophy hunting is a multi-million dollar industry - a licence to shoot a lion can cost up to $25,000 (Â£15,000) in neighbouring countries. Zambia's economy was built on the back of copper mining but now commodities are on a cyclical downward spiral. Consequently the country's currency, the kwacha, has lost a substantial amount of its value. For this small country, tourism is another way of bringing in foreign currency. There is no doubt that the beautiful banks of the Zambezi river in Livingstone and the Victoria Falls are still a draw card for international tourists but take a closer look at the numbers and it soon becomes clear that trophy hunters bring the lion's share of the greenback. Zambia's country director of the World Wildlife Fund Nyambe Nyambe told me that when the ban was initially announced back in 2013 ""there were not enough monitoring systems in place"". The government lifted the ban following expert recommendations which suggested that hunting resumption would ""assist communities in affected areas with access to financial benefits"", he said. Mr Nyambe also explained that ""concerns about the big cats conservation led to the ban in the first place and there is due recognition of the same as the ban is being lifted"". The authorities saw the need for a robust and implementable plan for leopards as well, as they have different needs to lions. Hunting regulations were structured only for lions because hunters were mostly interested in the king of the jungle. Mr Nyambe added: ""We hope and trust that the hunting of big cats will be an integral part of sustainable harvesting of wildlife resources."" But critics say there is no justification for shooting majestic animals such as the elusive African leopard just so that wealthy hunters, largely from the West, can pose for photos with dead animals. And there is one country on the continent that wants no part in the hunting of wildlife - Zambia's neighbour, Botswana. It has an established tradition of ""shoot with the camera not the gun"". Last week an American hunter paid $350,000 for a licence to shoot a black rhinoceros in Namibia. Corey Knowlton, from Texas, killed the rhino with a high-powered rifle after a three-day hunt through the bush with government officials on hand to ensure he killed the correct animal, which had reportedly been chosen as it was old and had become aggressive. Mr Knowlton, 36, won the right to shoot the rhino at an auction - attracting criticism, and even death threats, from conservationists. His supporters argued that the money raised would be used to protect other rhinos - there are just 5,000 left in the world, 2,000 of which are in Namibia. Zambia cannot be singled out for criticism because trophy hunting, albeit not always for endangered species or exotic animals, is allowed in many parts of the world including Europe and the US. But to be fair to the international hunter, local communities also hunt animals for their own purposes - whether to eat or to protect their livestock from predators. Animal rights groups hope that someday, in the not-too-distant future, there will come a time when the killing of wild animals will simply be outlawed.",Africa is home to some of the world's most majestic animals.,"[""Africa having majestic animals is supported by the text but there is no proof that they are some of the world's most majestic animals."", 'The summary states ""Africa"" as the subject, but the text speaks on Zambia and its policies.']",[],0
"Media playback is not supported on this device . Darren McCurry and Peter Harte led the charge with a combined total of 10 points as the Red Hands recovered from a slow start to triumph at Clones. Mickey Harte's holders will play Derry at Pairc Esler on Saturday in a repeat of the 2016 final. Derry saw off Monaghan 2-12 to 1-13 in the other semi-final at Armagh. Fermanagh started the game with a flourish, driven by energy and desire, and they ran at the Tyrone defence at every opportunity, using support runners to stretch their opponents. They went ahead through Eddie Courtney and Tomas Corrigan, and the Tyrone defence was under sustained pressure. Midfielder Eoin Donnelly charged through with a goal on his mind, but he was denied by a superb Peter Harte block. Tyrone finally got their opening score in the 10th minute when McCurry split the posts, and Niall McKenna brought the holders level moments later. The Tyrone defence grew in stature as the game wore on, and restricted the Erne men to just one point in the second quarter, a third free for Corrigan. An injury to Colm Cavanagh saw older brother Sean enter the action on the half-hour for his first appearance of 2017 and the beginning of a 16th season in the Tyrone county colours. Harte's fourth free sent Tyrone in with a 0-7 to 0-4 interval lead, and they started moving more freely in the second period, with McCurry taking over the free-taking duties, as well as adding a magnificent effort from play. They went ahead by 0-10 to 0-5 and, after Paul McCusker had pulled back an Erne point, the Red Hands went 0-13 to 0-6 up, with McCurry, Cathal McShane and Lee Brennan hitting the target.

Hearts' Jamie Walker was banned for a similar incident on the opening day of the season against Celtic. And Tierney said: ""It should be the same rule for every player."" Tierney was the player penalised in that match at Tynecastle in August, which Celtic won 2-1. The champions paid a two-point penalty for Schalk's antics on Sunday, and Tierney could barely believe referee Don Robertson awarded a spot-kick as he thinks the incident was even worse than the one involving Walker. ""I knew straight away it was a dive,"" said Tierney, who scored Celtic's opening goal on Sunday. ""It was the same kind of thing with Jamie Walker when we played Hearts in the first game of the season. But this incident was more obvious. ""It's not a nice part of the game, you can expect contact, but you're not going to go down if there's no contact. It's as simple as that. ""If it's striker's prerogative to do that then everyone would be falling about.

With Celtic likely to appeal against the red card, Brown will be available for Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers.

"This 6% increase in national income numbers gives the government more scope to cut its austerity programme. EU rules allow R&D investment, illicit gambling, drug dealing and activities linked to prostitution to be included. Separate figures showed the economy grew 2.7% in the first quarter of 2014. And the sharp contraction in the economy in the final three months of 2013 was revised to show that it shrank less than thought, by 0.1% rather than 2.3%. The GDP recalculation does not affect the growth figures, because previous years have also been recalculated. In October's budget, Finance Minister Michael Noonan outlined 2bn euros ($2.7bn) programme of tax hikes and spending cuts to meet a deficit target of 3% of GDP by the end of next year. Last month, he suggested that the enlargement of GDP under the new EU rules could mean the programme might be reined back, as the debt and deficit will appear smaller when measured against the new ""larger"" economy . Conall Mac Coille, chief economist at Davy Group, Ireland's biggest securities firm, estimated that the new numbers meant Ireland's debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 116% and its deficit at 6.7% of GDP at the end of last year . Previously, those figures had been 123.7% and 7.2%. He said: ""It's a measurement issue rather than a real improvement. But since exchequer returns were outperforming anyway, it looks as though the finance minister can bring the deficit down below 4% of GDP by the end of the year and hit his deficit target of 3% easily by the end of 2015, without having to do very much at all in the way of austerity."" Mr Mac Coille estimates that R&D expenditure contributed more than 90% of the extra GDP, with illegal activities making up the rest. Illegal activity is calculated using EU guidelines. There has been a raft of encouraging economic figures coming out of Ireland in recent months. Much of the growth is coming from exports, which grew 1.8% in the first three months. Even though personal consumption fell 0.1% in the first quarter, the unemployment rate now stands at 11.6%, the lowest level since April 2009. There have been some 30bn euro in tax hikes and spending cuts since the property bust of 2008 was followed by a banking collapse.

"Now Rosetta - Philae's European Space Agency (ESA) mothership - will switch off its electrical support system meaning it will no longer be possible to communicate with Philae. Rosetta will remain in orbit around the comet 67/P Churyumov-Gerasimenko until the 30 September, when controllers at ESA will crash the spacecraft into the surface, using the opportunity to gather close-up photos and data as it falls. Philae has asked for picture postcards to be shared as a way of marking its shutdown. Philae's official job on Comet 67P was to acquire as much information about the comet as possible. It would record and transmit pictures. It was a job greatly appreciated by NASA who also tweeted thanks and goodbye. Philae and its spacecraft called Rosetta developed a relationship on social media with the two exchanging musings about their new location, the view, power sources and crucially, the icy cold conditions.

"Rockstar's controversial game - where players commit crime in the fictional city of Los Santos - was presented with the Game of the Year gong at a ceremony in central London. Sony's The Last of Us also scooped two awards. Ken Levine - the man behind Bioshock and System Shock 2 - was honoured with a lifetime achievement award. The Golden Joysticks are the largest publicly-voted video game awards in the world, with this year more than 10 million people casting a vote. The Lifetime Achievement is a new addition to the ceremony. Mr Levine has been a high profile figure in the industry ever since he worked with designer Doug Church, on the first-person shooter, Thief: The Dark Project, credited with being one of the first titles to introduce the concept of stealth into video games. ""The great thing about the still-maturing nature of video games is you get to be inspired by the work of novices and veterans alike,"" he said. ""We're all figuring out day by day exactly what the medium is capable of."" Now in its 31st year, the awards were first given out back in 1983, with the first Game of the Year award going to Jet Pac on the ZX Spectrum. Andy Robinson, editor of Computer and Videogames, said that three decades on, the awards still ""represent the voice of gamers worldwide"". ""We've revamped the categories to reflect the diversity of modern gaming and also added the inaugural Lifetime Achievement award, which has made this year's ceremony the most thrilling for us yet,"" he said.

"The pilgrims congregated from sunrise at the site and the vast plain which surrounds it, about 15km from Mecca. Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad gave his last sermon at the location. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which all Muslims are called upon to perform at least once. On Saturday it emerged that Saudi Arabia's top cleric, Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh, would not deliver the traditional Hajj sermon for the first time in 35 years because of health complications. It follows controversy sparked by his remarks that Iranians were ""not Muslims"". The comments came after Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denounced Saudi Arabia's management of the Hajj. Iran has boycotted this year's pilgrimage., instead endorsing an alternative event on Saturday at the holy city of Karbala in Iraq. Tensions between the two countries have risen after a crush in last year's pilgrimage killed at least 2,426 people, including 464 Iranians, according to an unofficial count. Saudi Arabia and Iran do not have diplomatic relations and are at loggerheads over a series of regional issues including the conflicts in Yemen and Syria. But news of the Ayatollah's absence has not diminished the enthusiasm of the pilgrims. ""It's marvellous,"" Egyptian pilgrim Louza, 45, was quoted as saying. ""I'm here closer to God. It's an indescribable feeling."" Against a backdrop of other mountains the pilgrims squatted, stood, or climbed up steps constructed into the hill while reciting incantations. ""We feel at ease and are totally benefiting from our pilgrimage,"" Soumaya, 30, from Mali, told the AFP news agency. Her friend, Khadija Bechir, 23. agreed, praising the event for being well organised. Pilgrims come from all over the world to the Hajj but Indonesia - the most populous Muslim nation - has the largest quota. Official figures issued late on Saturday revealed that more than 1.3 million pilgrims attending the Hajj are from outside Saudi Arabia. A vast expanse of white fireproof tents has been pitched at Mina, to accommodate in excess of 2.5 million pilgrims. The stampede in Mina last September is considered to be the worst disaster in Hajj history. It took place as pilgrims were going to the Jamarat Bridge for a stoning ritual which this this year will start on Monday, officials say.

"Their 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is twice the length of a normal stay. Their extended tour is part of an effort to study the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the body. But scientists will gain further insights by comparing Scott Kelly with his Earthbound identical twin, Mark. A Soyuz capsule carrying Kelly, Kornienko and Russian crew member Sergey Volkov parachuted down on to a steppe in Kazakhstan at 10:26 local time (04:26 GMT). The mission is a record for the ISS and will give Cmdr Kelly a tally of 520 cumulative days in space, over four flights. In pictures: Scott Kelly's year in space . Tim Peake's space plant experiment . Cmdr Kelly has also returned rocket (salad) seeds that were taken up to the orbiting outpost by UK astronaut Tim Peake in December. They will be distributed to schools to allow pupils to compare their growth with rocket plants that have stayed on Earth. The idea behind the twin study is to help minimise extraneous factors as scientists research how genetically identical individuals respond to different conditions over a year. The harsh space environment takes its toll in the form of muscle atrophy, sleep problems, bone loss, vision impairment and radiation exposure. But some of the most pronounced effects are on the mind. Before landing, Cmdr Kelly told reporters during a live link-up: ""Physically I feel pretty good... but the hardest part is being isolated in the physical sense from people on the ground who are important to you. There's a loss of connection."" From Kazakhstan, Cmdr Kelly will be flown to Houston in the US, where researchers at the US space agency (Nasa) will begin a series of scientific checks. Mark Kelly, who was an astronaut, now retired, has been undergoing tests of his own on Earth during his brother's sojourn on the ISS. Comparisons between the twins should allow scientists to deepen their understanding of the subtle physical and psychological shifts that occur during long stays on orbit. Nasa says the research should inform its stated aim of one day sending humans to Mars. After returning from an extended stay in the weightless environment of space, many astronauts have difficulty walking unaided. Shortly after landing, Kelly, Kornienko and Volkov will enter a medical tent to participate in a series of ""field tests"" that will assess their balance, co-ordination and ability to walk. Returning ISS crews have immediate access to medical assistance, but future crews to Mars will have little time to recover once they land on the Red Planet's surface. Scientists want to devise ways to prevent injury and improve their recovery time. ""We go through about an hour of field tests of various kinds - one is even like an obstacle course, where you run around, stand up from a sitting position and jump,"" Cmdr Kelly said. Despite the length of their flight, Kelly and Kornienko are still some way shy of the record for the longest single spaceflight, which is held by the Russian Valery Polyakov, who spent 437 consecutive days aboard the Mir space station in the mid-1990s. On Monday, Scott Kelly handed over command of the space station to his American colleague Timothy Kopra, who remains on the orbiting outpost with Tim Peake and the Russian Yuri Malenchenko.

"The 1912 painting was purchased by the London gallery in early February. The museum paid Â£15.6m ($25.5m) for the artwork. The money will go towards operating costs at Randolph College in Virginia, which owns the Maier Museum. AAMD, which represents 236 directors of leading US art museums, called upon the college ""to stop this practice"". The Association was it was ""deeply disturbed to learn of Randolph College's continuing sale of works of art from the collection of its Maier Museum of Art to provide general operating funds for the College"". ""The prohibition against the sale of works of art from museum collections for such purposes is a violation of one of the most fundamental professional principles of the art museum field,"" a statement said.

But in 2008 the college sold a Rufino Tamayo painting, Trovador, prompting the AAMD to censure the Maier Museum ""to signal its objection to this action"" and ""discourage"" further sales from the collection. Following last month's Bellows sale, it once again sought ""to encourage the College to find other solutions"" to support their operating costs. The college's unwillingness to alter their course led to the announcement of sanctions, which calls on all AAMD member museums to suspend loans to the Maier Museum and refuse collaboration on joint exhibitions.

"As violent protests erupted in the capital, Delhi, at the weekend over the horrific gang rape of a 23-year-old student, many Indians were asking this question. It took nearly a week of protests for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to appear on TV pleading for calm and promising to make India safer for women. Many thought it was ironical that India's most powerful woman, Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi, met a group of outraged students only after massive public demonstrations had been widely televised. Many believe that the violence could have been prevented if either Mr Singh or Mrs Gandhi, or even one of the young ministers, had gone to meet the protesters and promised stern action against wrongdoers and reform of India's broken criminal justice system. That was not all. The city police commissioner told a news channel that even men were unsafe in Delhi as ""their pockets were picked"" - a shocking gaffe that appeared to equate rape with pick-pocketing. Federal Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde told another channel that ministers could not be expected to personally meet every group of protestors, ""like political party workers or Maoists"", appearing again to equate ultra-left rebels with angry students, justly upset over the rising tide of crimes against women. Many attribute such attitudes to the sheer hubris of India's ruling class - ""they are our rulers, not representatives"", was an angry refrain during the protests last week - in what many cynics describe as a modern-day ""feudal democracy"". Others argue it points to the increasing disconnect between India's rulers and its people, the perpetuation of what many call a paternalistic ruling class which talks to its citizens rather than listening to them. Many politicians and bureaucrats appear to lack communication skills to engage with a young, increasingly empowered and aspirational citizenry, who are demanding more from their rulers. ""Young India, old politicians,"" as author Gurcharan Das once described this dichotomy. Such alienation bodes ill for the future of the world's largest democracy, some think. Analysts like Pratap Bhanu Mehta argue that it leads to the disengagement of democracy from legitimacy. ""India's citizens vote in large numbers"", he says, ""but if the same citizens were truly engaged in the process of making laws, laws would be seen as legitimate and there would be minimal need for enforcement"". I believe there is one more reason for this anomie: the decline of genuine mass politicians. Time was when India was known for its charismatic, mass-based politicians - Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan were just some of them - who could easily lead from the front. Today, there are only a handful, two of whom - Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee - are actually women. The reticent prime minister himself has never won an election, and Mrs Gandhi and her son and heir apparent, Rahul Gandhi, hardly speak to the citizens. When he was going around Delhi in 1947 after India's bloody partition, Nehru saw Hindus and Muslims rioting. He jumped out of his car, broke the security cordon, ran into the crowd and stopped the clash. Mahatma Gandhi routinely travelled to trouble spots to stop religious clashes and douse tensions. Last week, not a single leader came forward to engage with protesting students demanding safety for women.",Is India's ruling class so arrogant that it is unable to stop violence against women?,[],[],1

"The country's Central Election Commission said that there had been a record turnout of 95.11% for the poll. The result, giving 74-year-old Mr Nazarbayev a fifth consecutive five-year term, had never been in doubt. The president has promised economic and social stability in the oil-rich Central Asian state. He ran virtually unopposed as his two opponents were both seen as pro-government. Human rights groups accuse the authorities of systematically repressing the opposition. Mr Nazarbayev cast his ballot to loud cheering in the capital Astana, saying he was sure that the people of Kazakhstan would support his campaign. ""I am sure Kazakhstan's people will vote primarily for the stable development of our state and the improvement of people's lives, as well as the stability of the state and in support of the policies the country has implemented under my leadership,"" he told journalists.

Domestic producers have been dismissing workers as they struggle to compete against Russian imports made cheaper by the weakening of the sanctions-hit rouble. Elections had been due in 2016, but President Nazarbayev announced they would be held a year early in what some see as a move intended to halt speculation about any possible successor. A former Communist politburo member, Mr Nazarbayev has been president of Kazakhstan since before it became independent in 1991 following the break-up of the former Soviet Union.

"Following the announcement of the new global calendar in March, Premiership Rugby confirmed the 2019-20 domestic season will start in early September and finish at the end of June. However, players have voiced their concerns about the schedule. ""I think it fills us all with a bit with dread,"" Tigers hooker Youngs, 30, told BBC Radio 5 live. ""I know they are trying to look after us a little bit, but that's a long time. It's long enough now."" Premiership Rugby say the 10-month campaign will allow clubs to become ""more sophisticated"" in their management of players, with chief executive Mark McCafferty insisting player welfare remains the priority. But Youngs, who has 28 England caps and three for the British and Irish Lions - is among those to stress the need for a long summer break and pre-season, rather than shorter rest periods during the campaign. ""It would shorten pre-seasons, and pre-season is so vital to get us ready to go through the season,"" he added.

"Col Israel Shomer fired at Mohammed Kasbeh after the 17-year-old threw a stone at his vehicle in the West Bank. Israel's military said at the time that Col Shomer felt his life was in danger. But the video released by B'Tselem appears to show the teenager running away after attacking the vehicle. Soldiers then jump out and pursue him. B'Tselem also said medical evidence suggested that he was shot in the back. The Israeli military has not commented on the video, but the Times of Israel reported that Col Shomer had been interviewed under caution by military police investigating the shooting following its release. The incident took place on 3 July at the Qalandiya checkpoint between Jerusalem and Ramallah, the scene of frequent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops. A vehicle carrying Col Shomer, commander of the army's Binyamin Brigade, was hit by stones thrown by a group of youths, shattering its windshield. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said at the time that the colonel got out of the vehicle and ordered the stone-throwers to stop, firing a warning shot into the air. When the attack continued, he opened fire at the main perpetrator, it added. The IDF stressed that Col Shomer believed he was in ""imminent mortal danger"" and several members of the government praised his actions. But witnesses cast doubt on the commander's account. Ahmed Taher, 17, who was throwing rocks beside Kasbeh, told the Washington Post after his funeral: ""We were running away."" Fahdi Ziad, who works at a nearby petrol station, told the Guardian that three Israeli soldiers - two wearing a helmet, and one without one - chased after the teenagers and opened fire. Mr Ziad said Kasbeh was about 10-15m (33-49ft) from the soldiers when he was shot. ""After he fell on the ground the soldier without the helmet went and checked him and kicked him,"" he added. Palestinian doctors also said the teenager was shot in the back and the side of the head. On Monday, B'Tselem released video footage recorded by a security camera at the petrol station showing the moments before the shooting. It shows a person believed to be Kasbeh running at the Israeli army vehicle as it passes by and throwing a stone. He then runs away as the car then brakes suddenly and at least two soldiers get out, brandishing weapons. In a statement, B'Tselem said the footage showed Col Shomer's claim of self-defence was ""unreasonable"". ""There is no doubt that the shattering of the jeep's front window with a stone endangered the passengers when it happened. However, Kasbeh was shot in the back after the fact, when he was already running away and posing no 'mortal threat' to the soldiers. Feeling a sense of danger is not enough to justify any action."" The rights group also noted that the video contradicted the IDF's claim that Col Shomer had carried out ""suspect-arrest procedure"". ""Military open-fire regulations permit shooting at the legs of a suspect in order to facilitate his arrest. They do not permit killing him by firing three shots at his upper body,"" it added.

"Nine Madryn Street, Toxteth, where the drummer lived until he was four, is among 271 homes which are due to be cleared under regeneration plans. Housing Minister Grant Shapps had asked for alternative plans to be considered to renovate the homes. The communities secretary still needs to approve the plans before demolition. Eric Pickles is considering a request by campaigners for a full environmental assessment before the area is razed. The street is one of several known as the Welsh Streets, which were built in the late 19th Century when there was an influx of Welsh people who came to Liverpool to work as dockers. At a planning meeting at Liverpool Town Hall earlier, residents of the streets pleaded with the council to knock down what they called ""damp slums"" and replace them with modern homes. Opponents of the demolition said the streets had historical importance to Beatles fans as well as potential tourist value. The childhood homes of John Lennon - Mendips, in Menlove Avenue - and Sir Paul McCartney - in Forthlin Road - are preserved as tourist attractions supported by the National Trust. George Harrison's Arnold Grove childhood home remains a private house. A request for the Madryn Street house to be put under a preservation order was turned down by English Heritage last year, which ruled the property had no associations with the success of the Beatles as a group. Liverpool City Council Leader Joe Anderson said the area was in dire need of regeneration. He said: ""A majority of the local community have expressed support for our plans since we started consulting on this plan over a decade ago. ""They are sick of living in poky, damp infested properties. They want and deserve decent, modern homes with gardens and space for a car and are exasperated and frustrated at the delays to this scheme."" He added: ""I pledged last year that if a developer came forward with a viable proposal to retain the Welsh Streets then we would look seriously at their plans. I am sorry to say that this has not happened. ""It is simply not fair to keep the local community in limbo any longer. ""People have been voting with their feet for years and moving away from the Welsh Streets which is why the housing market in the area has completely collapsed."" Irene Milson, chair of the tenants' and residents' association, said of the decision to demolish the house: ""I can't explain, I really can't explain, it's jubilation. ""It's been 10 years of hard work from the start to now, I just can't put it into words."" However Phillip Coppell, chairman of the Save Madryn Street campaign, said the fight was not yet over. He said: ""Demolition is not a foregone conclusion. We have people waiting in the wings who are prepared to redevelop the area and refurbish so we are still hopeful.

"The national chain, based in Langholm, is accused of committing the offence on two occasions in 2014. A trial began at Dumfries Sheriff Court last month but reporting restrictions prevented publicity. Lawyers for the company argued it could have affected witnesses and voiced concerns about the business impact but the ban has now been overturned. The alleged offences, brought under the Textile Products Regulations 2012, are said to have taken place at the company's store in Church Place, Dumfries, one of 265 high street shops. When the trial began at Dumfries Sheriff Court on 15 September, Susan Duff QC, for the accused, argued against an application on behalf of the BBC and ITV Border to revoke the ban, arguing that publicity could affect the evidence of witnesses who are yet to come to court. She also said: ""The accused has a legitimate concern about its business and employees. ""Now is the busiest time of year for the purchase of cashmere."" She said reporting that scarves were not 100% cashmere could be ""prejudicial to the legitimate interests"" of the firm. But Ronnie Clancy QC, for the BBC, argued that this being ""the busiest time of year for Christmas orders"" was simply a reputational issue, not covered by the Contempt of Court Act under which the ban was made. Sheriff George Jamieson agreed to revoke the interim order he had previously made, and allowed the case to be reported. Previously, Alison Irving, 52, a trading standards officer at Dumfries and Galloway Council, told the court she had test purchased a blue tartan scarf in February 2014 and a red one four months later. Both scarves were reduced to Â£30 from Â£60 and were labelled as 100% Lochmere cashmere, the court heard. Ms Irving later cut the scarves into pieces, bagged and sealed them and sent them off to be analysed at two different test labs - SGS UK and Intertek UK. It emerged that she was acting on information from the Cashmere and Camelhair Manufacturers Institute (CCMI). On receiving reports back from the test labs, Ms Irving said she sent a letter in August 2014 cautioning EWM. She said she notified the business that one scarf had been found to contain 84.4% cashmere, while the other was found to have 61.6% cashmere, with the remainder made up of other wool fibres. Under cross-examination from Ms Duff, the witness said it was ""odd"" that the results received back from each of the labs had been different from each other. ""They were different from each other but neither said they were 100%,"" she said. The witness confirmed that after sending EWM a sample, the company sent back results from another test lab showing that both scarves were found to be 100% cashmere. Ms Duff also challenged the evidence of a textile analyst Liqin Zhang who gave evidence saying she identified wool and yak in the scarf samples. Ms Duff told Ms Zhang that EWM had sent a DNA tested 100% cashmere sample for her to analyse in August 2016. The lawyer said the fabric had been subject to the same processes and dyed the same colour as the red scarf sample previously tested. Ms Duff told Ms Zhang: ""You identified that 100% cashmere sample as 85% cashmere and 15% unidentifiable fibres. ""The issue is with your identification and not with the product, isn't it?"" Ms Zhang replied: ""If the fibre structure is damaged I have to report it as unidentifiable, I can't just guess."" Ms Duff continued: ""You couldn't identify fibres that were 100% cashmere, that's down to your ability?"" Ms Zhang replied: ""That's my decision on what my observation is. I'm not saying I'm perfect."" The trial continues.","A sheriff has lifted a ban on reporting the trial of retailer EWM, accused of falsely claiming cashmere scarves were 100% cashmere.",['The summary states the ban was lifted by the sheriff but the source text indicates the ban was lifted by the Dumfries Sheriff Court.'],,0

But there is no room in that category for The Night Manager - despite it being shortlisted for six Bafta Craft Awards last month. Nor is there a space for Coronation Street in the soap and continuing drama category, where preference has been given to Casualty, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks. Colman may not have been recognised for The Night Manager, but she is up for best female comedy performance for her role in BBC Three's Fleabag. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the show's creator, is nominated alongside her in that category, while the show is also up for best scripted comedy. Foy, who was up for lead actress last year for Wolf Hall, receives her second nomination in consecutive years, this time for playing the young Queen Elizabeth II. Three of her co-stars in The Crown - Jared Harris, John Lithgow and Vanessa Kirby - are also recognised, for playing King George VI, Winston Churchill and Princess Margaret respectively. Strictly Come Dancing is nominated for best entertainment programme, with an additional nomination for Claudia Winkleman for best entertainment performance.

Residents have been complaining about the smell from the site, described as like rotten eggs or sewage, for several weeks. Green Party councillor Sarah Finch said it reached its worst levels earlier in the week. ""It smells like normal household gas, sometimes with a tinge of sewage smell,"" she added. ""It is a very unpleasant smell which catches in your throat and can make you gag."" Paul Bennett, from the Environment Agency, said officers were at the site at least once a day to collect data. The information will be sent to Public Health England to assess whether it poses a risk. ""If Biffa don't keep the gas within the site and we find that they are breaching their environmental permit, then we are going to consider formal action against the company,"" he said.

A similar drubbing appeared on the cards when the Serb raced into a 4-0 lead with two breaks of serve. After a week of one-sided matches at the O2 Arena there was relief all around when Berdych recovered from 15-30 to get on the scoreboard in game five, but it was hardly a signal of intent.

"South Africa's Equality Court fined Jon Qwelane $14,450 (Â£8,920) and ordered him to apologise for promoting hatred in the column published in 2008. Headlined ""Call me names but gay is NOT OKAY"", it caused an uproar at the time. Mr Qwelane, who was appointed last year to Uganda where homosexual acts are illegal, did not mount a defence. Correspondents say the outcome of the case is particularly significant in the light of the recent attacks and rapes of lesbian women in South Africa. Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships. ""We are hoping really that this finding will send a message to community members, a message that says gay and lesbian people have an equal right to the protection of their dignity,"" said Vincent Moaga, spokesman for the South African Human Rights Commission, which initiated the complaint against Mr Qwelane. The Sunday Sun officially apologised for the column following complaints after its publication, but Mr Qwelane refused to make an apology. The court agreed with commission's argument that Mr Qwelane's article, and the cartoon accompanying it, had promoted hatred against homosexuals, causing them emotional suffering. Mr Moaga said the money from the fine would be donated to gay rights organisations. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Qwelane was appointed as ambassador last year, raising concerns that he would fuel tensions in Uganda which has come under intense international pressure over plans to tighten laws against homosexuality. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill, first introduced in 2009 and yet to be voted on in Uganda's parliament, seeks to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in prison to life.

"The sculpture of Themis - the goddess of justice - wearing a sari was less than six months old, but Islamist groups demanded its removal by Friday. They claimed it hurt the religious sentiments of Muslims and it prompted mass protests in the capital, Dhaka. PM Sheikh Hasina agreed to its removal, but secular groups opposed it. Workers came with equipment and a crane at midnight to uproot the controversial statue, the BBC's Bangla service reported. The statue is being removed to maintain peace, said its creator Mrinal Haque. Analysts say this is a sign of the rising tension between Islamic conservatism and liberal values in Bangladesh. Protesters have long asserted that the figure, which held the familiar sword and scales of justice in her hands, amounted to idolatry. In February, conservative Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam led protests and threatened to spread the demonstrations across the country if the statue was not removed. Many of those protesting will have been followers of Hefazat-e-Islam, but observers have also pointed to increasing conservatism among the general public.

"Kevin Nunes was shot dead in September 2002 but five men jailed for his murder were freed on appeal. Police and crime commissioner (PCC) Matthew Ellis said Mrs Sawyers had ""no case to answer on misconduct or gross misconduct"" relating to the case. Ms Sawyers welcomed the decision. Police believe Mr Nunes was a drug dealer who was shot in an execution-style killing in Pattingham after straying into another gang's territory. But the men jailed for his murder were freed after it emerged concerns over the credibility of witnesses were not disclosed to the defence. This prompted an investigation into the police's handling of a key witness and how disclosure was dealt with afterwards. In January 2014, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it would be submitting files to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) over the case for prosecuting senior officers, including Mrs Sawyers, for either attempting to pervert the course of justice or criminal misconduct. However, the CPS said there was not enough evidence to proceed. Publishing his response, Mr Ellis said while it was clear ""something went wrong in relation to the investigation of the murder"", Mrs Sawyers was not guilty of misconduct. ""My conclusion is that, whilst there were undoubtedly different actions and decisions that should have been taken at the time, the IPCC report does not produce evidence Mrs Sawyers has a case to answer in respect of misconduct or gross misconduct,"" he said.

"Simon Brown, 24, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, hit his head on a signal gantry on 7 August. The hearing in London was told that passenger Kirstin Duffield heard a ""loud thud"". In a statement read by the coroner, she said she found Mr Brown with an injury that was ""not survivable"". The train from Gatwick to London Victoria was travelling at about 60mph when the incident happened near Balham, south London. Mark Young, from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), told the hearing Mr Brown's head was out of the window with no evidence to indicate why. He said Mr Brown suffered a fatal head injury as a result of striking a signal gantry. Ms Duffield said she saw Mr Brown had collapsed in the corridor after she stood up from her seat, but saw he was still breathing. ""There was a lot of blood on the floor and around his head. There was a massive trauma to the top of his head,"" she said. She said it became apparent there was nothing she could do for him. The inquest heard Ms Duffield got off the train at Wandsworth Common after the alarm was raised and the driver had been alerted. She said she saw ""blood splatter"" on the outside of the carriage, but had not seen Mr Brown with his head out of the window. Mr Brown's mother, Jane Street, said her son had a passion for railways and ""was neither reckless nor ignorant of the dangers of that environment"". In a statement, she said her son first volunteered on the Bluebell Railway as a nine-year-old and had recently become an engineering technician with Hitachi Rail Europe in Bristol. Mr Brown's father, Mike Brown, said his son had been due to move in with his girlfriend and he had ""never seen him so relaxed, happy and enthusiastic about his future"".

He also said it had been found the distance between the gantry and a moving carriage could have been as little as 68mm. He said the window opposite the guard's compartment was not intended for passenger use, although it was accessible to anyone on the train and open when the train left Gatwick.

Meanwhile, a No 10 aide apologised for any offence after saying benefits should go to ""really disabled people"". No 10 policy unit head George Freeman had faced calls to apologise after saying on Sunday those ""taking pills at home, who suffer from anxiety"" should not receive Personal Independence Payments. On Monday he tweeted: ""Having experienced myself traumatic anxiety as a child carer living w alcohol I know all too well the pain anxiety + depression causes... ""Which is why as a former health minister and policy adviser I am passionate about supporting mental health and disability, and hugely regret if my comment about the need to prioritise the most 'serious disabilities' inadvertently caused any offence which was not intended."" The prime minister's official spokesman said the Personal Independence Payments (PIP) reforms were not about saving money and said that about Â£50bn a year was spent on supporting people with disabilities and health conditions. ""The government has been clear on the parity of esteem we want to see between mental and physical health,"" the spokesman said. ""What we are doing now is restoring the original intention of the PIPs which was to make sure there was a sustainable benefit to provide continued support to those who face the greatest barrier to living independent lives."" Pressed on whether the prime minister had a message for those who could be affected by the changes, the spokesman said ""nobody is losing out"". He said a recent tribunal on assessments for PIP payments had ""broadened"" the criteria. The government is proposing changes to PIPs, which replaced the Disability Living Allowance, after tribunal rulings that claimants with psychological problems who cannot travel without help must be treated like those who are blind. The government says the rulings - if unchallenged - would have added Â£3.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023. The benefit is intended to help people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs. Disabilities minister Penny Mordaunt said she was reforming the PIP payments to ""restore the original aim of the benefit"" to make sure support was given to the most needy. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was ""furious"" about the proposed changes to PIPS, and said Labour would pressurise the government to reverse them in next month's Budget.

""What I can guarantee is that...once we leave the EU, we won't be spending that budget on EU membership, and the things that currently we delegate to the EU we will be funding ourselves,"" he said.

Recent data has suggested that China's economic growth continues to slow down. As well as the volatility in Chinese shares, there are fears of a protracted effect on demand for commodities. China's slowdown is expected to pull down other regional economies, affecting energy and raw material consumption. The unstable Chinese market has also led to worries that the problems in the world's second largest economy may have far-reaching global consequences. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index on Monday shed as much as 8%, while markets in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney all dropped by more than 4%. On Friday, figures showed China's factory activity in August shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years. Official figures have indicated that China's economic growth is continuing to slow. For the three months to the end of July, the economy grew by 7% compared with a year earlier - its slowest pace since 2009. Bernard Aw, market strategist with trading firm IG, said given the tepid demand, it was hard to fathom why oil producers were pumping out more crude. Opec producers, notably Saudi Arabia, and Iraq were producing more oil than necessary, while US stockpiles were nearly 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average. ""At this rate, the fundamentals of oil are going to get worse before it gets better as the supply glut widens. This means we are likely to see more weakness in oil futures in the coming sessions,"" Mr Aw said. Oil dealers are also anticipating revised US economic growth data for the second quarter, to be released on Thursday. The figures could be key to the Federal Reserve's thoughts on when to raise interest rates. An eventual interest rate rise is expected to strengthen the US dollar, which in turn would make dollar-priced oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, once again affecting demand.",Oil prices have fallen below $40 a barrel for the first time in more than two years.,"['The summary claims that prices have fallen below $40 for the first time in more than two years, but the text does not provide any information regarding the duration of time since prices were last below that level']",,0
"Thousands of miners and police clashed at the South Yorkshire coking site. Campaigners met with Home Secretary Amber Rudd to renew calls for a probe into police handling of the event.

A delegation from the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign (OTJC), which met with the Home Secretary, said they were feeling ""positive"" after the meeting. The so-called Battle of Orgreave saw miners attempt to stop lorry loads of coke leaving for the steel works, with police holding them back.

"Gerard Coyne accused Unite's current general secretary, Len McCluskey, of ""dabbling in politics all the time"". Mr Coyne, the union's West Midlands secretary, launched his campaign for the top job in Birmingham. Unite is Labour's biggest donor and Mr McCluskey has been one of leader Jeremy Corbyn's key backers in the face of opposition from some MPs. Mr McCluskey has already announced plans to resign as general secretary but to stand again for the position, a move which brings forward the election by a year. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Coyne's challenge would be seen by the Labour leader's allies as a political attack. She added that Mr Coyne was understood to be concerned about Mr Corbyn's anti-Trident stance given that thousands of Unite members work in the defence industry. Announcing his candidacy on his Facebook page, Mr Coyne, who has worked for the union for more than 20 years having joined as a shop worker at Sainsbury's, said: ""I believe our union needs to be changed so we can get on with the only job that matters; protecting and defending our members at work."" ""We have got to be strong, smart and organised but we can't be distracted party politics. ""As a candidate, my priority is making a real difference for you rather than playing Westminster power games. It's time we changed the union to reflect our members' priorities.""

Atletico cannot sign anyone until January after failing in an appeal against a ban imposed in July 2016 for breaching Fifa rules over the signing of youth players.

Barry, who beat five other contenders, was awarded a Â£10,000 prize. His novel is set in Dorinish, an uninhabited island off the Irish coast, which Lennon bought in 1967 for Â£1,700. Set in 1978, it follows the former Beatle as he visits the island to attend a course of primal scream therapy. The author described it as ""a play for voices"".

"Barrister Mona Bayoumi's comments come as a Welsh Assembly committee holds an inquiry into human rights in Wales. The committee said its inquiry is instrumental in ensuring the assembly is prepared for future changes. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the UK government was ""committed"" to reforming domestic human rights. Speaking to Sunday Politics Wales, Ms Bayoumi said: ""Just to put it in to some context, there was obviously existing UK legislation going back to the 70s that protected, for example, employee rights in respect of discrimination, so it's important to remember that. ""But yes absolutely, I do think that there will be a slow erosion of the existing rights and protections, that really is in line with the debate that we've heard."" The UK government has proposed replacing the Human Rights Act 1998, which could curtail the role of the European Court of Human Rights. The assembly's Equality Committee is looking at how this could affect Wales. All Welsh Assembly laws must comply with human rights legislation, and with Theresa May repeatedly saying Britain would be better served by leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, the terms of the legislation could change. Newport East AM and committee chairman John Griffiths admitted there was ""a lot of worry that some of the inclusive practises that we've built in Wales are under threat at the moment"". Wales has to ""guard against that"", he said. Mr Griffiths acknowledged there was an issue with how the public view human rights laws, following recent debates about votes for prisoners and human rights regulations blocking criminals from being deported. ""There can be a problem with public perception but it can mainly come, I think, from media sensationalism around fairly atypical cases,"" he said.

"Supermarket worker David Sinclair, 34, shook his five-month-old son Joshua in a fit of anger, causing him to die at Hairmyres Hospital hours later. At the High Court in Glasgow, Sinclair pleaded guilty to culpable homicide in regard to the infant's death on 6 December, 2012. He is due to return to the court for sentencing next month. Sinclair was originally charged with murder, but admitted the reduced charge of culpable homicide, just days before he was due to go on trial. Prosecutor Ashley Edwards said that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his now wife Kirsty and Joshua went swimming and then shopping in East Kilbride. At 17:30 Kirsty Sinclair went out to meet her mother and sister. Just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from Sinclair, who sounded ""shocked"".

One of the experts, Dr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neuro-surgeon at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said: ""This would be compatible with him having suffered a shaking injury involving handling at greater force than encountered in everyday life. ""It would be compatible with a shaking event where a carer, who has not planned to injure a child, has a momentary loss of control with tragic consequences.""

"The supermarket giant said its overseas division had sold 8.6% of its Lazada stake to Chinese internet giant Alibaba for $129m (£90.6m). Tesco will retain an 8.3% holding in the South East Asia-focused business. The move comes the day before Tesco's annual results, in which it is expected to announce further disposals. The supermarket group is planning to sell off some of its side businesses, including Dobbies Garden Centres chain, coffee shop chain Harris & Hoole and restaurant chain Giraffe, so that it can focus on the main supermarket business, according to media reports. Last September, Tesco sold its South Korean business, Homeplus, for £4.2bn to help shore up its balance sheet and revitalise its UK business. There has been speculation about possible disposals since chief executive Dave Lewis took the helm in September 2014, charged with reviving the group's fortunes. Mr Lewis was parachuted in after the supermarket reported it had overstated its profits by some £263m. Alongside this, like its ""big four"" peers - Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - Tesco has been hit by competition from discount rivals Lidl and Aldi. The UK has also seen a broad change in shopping habits, with many customers preferring to shop little and often at small convenience stores, instead of doing a once-a-week ""big shop"". In April last year, the company reported a record pre-tax loss of £6.4bn for the year to February, marking the biggest loss reported to date by a British retailer. Mr Lewis has focused on price cuts and putting more staff in stores in an attempt to revive sales. On Wednesday, he is expected to report a rise in underlying fourth-quarter sales, the group's first quarterly increase for more than three years.

There is also raspberry jam tagged ""anabolic"" in reference to steroids also banned in sports. ""Not everyone realised this was a humorous present from RT,"" the broadcaster said. It has consistently denied and ridiculed allegations of a state-sponsored doping programme in Russia. One of the gift boxes was sent to Yulia Efimova, who won two swimming silver medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics. A photo posted on Russia's leading social networking website VKontakte shows a smiling Efimova with test tubes and vials apparently containing food, such as jam, honey and condiments. On its website, RT gave further details of its gift pack which it suggested had also been sent to other people. The website carried a video from the Twitter account of blogger Evgeny Kozlov showing one of the kits being unpacked. People from RT are ""unbelievably creative"", he said. The kits also include cards said to be based on drawings by children from an orphanage. ""A New Year's card that you will never throw away,"" said Yulia Ostroukhova, apparently another recipient of the gift box. ""Very nice.

"Scientists are recruiting 64 healthy adult volunteers for the trial, which is expected to take up to two years. The work will be split equally between London, the Rwandan capital Kigali and Nairobi in Kenya. This early trial is being run by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a non-profit organisation. The principal investigator, Dr Jill Gilmour, who has worked at the laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital since its founding in 2001, says she is optimistic that the Aids virus can eventually be tackled with a vaccine. The virus is now 30 years old, and the search for a vaccine has proved elusive so far. However, an American-backed trial in Thailand found in 2009 that a combination of two vaccine prototypes was 30% effective in preventing HIV infection. Follow-up trials are being planned with the aim of improving those initial results. In the IAVI trial, volunteers who are free of HIV and not at risk of catching the infection will receive a combination of two vaccines. One of them is derived from a weakened version of Sendai, a flu-like virus that infects rodents. It will be administered through nasal drops. This is because in the early stages of infection, both HIV and Sendai affect the mucosal tissues, which are found in the nose and also in the genital area. Dr Gilmour said: ""I believe it's not if, it's when we will have an effective HIV vaccine. There is now strong scientific data to support that position. ""We will get there but vaccine development takes time. It's not for the faint-hearted. ""Bear in mind that with polio, it was 45 years from discovering the virus to getting an effective vaccine. ""HIV is a formidable beast with sneaky tricks. It changes every time it divides, so it's highly variable. And it can integrate into your own cells, so your immune system can't see it."" The trial is early work known as Phase I, meaning that the aim is to ensure the vaccine is safe and induces an immune response. Dr Gilmour added: ""Delivering the vaccine into the nose has public health benefits, because we're not using needles. ""If we see strong immune responses, we go into the larger second phase of testing whether the vaccine is effective in reducing transmission or lowering the load of the virus. ""The Sendai product is modified from a virus which affects rodents, including hamsters. From our perspective, it's a bonus that this virus has lived in the human environment without causing us harm."" The IAVI laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster handles almost 100,000 blood samples a year and has supported more than 20 other vaccine trials. Its work includes sending test kits to sub-Saharan African countries at the heart of the Aids epidemic, carefully tracking the thousands of blood samples that it holds and ships elsewhere, and ensuring the data and paperwork from trials is rigorously monitored, so the results from different sets of tests can be pooled. Jason Warriner, clinical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ""We welcome investment in the search for a vaccine against HIV. This research is in its very earliest stages. Clinical trials take several years to complete and, even if the vaccine passes this first stage of tests, more research will be needed over the course of many years. ""Although an HIV vaccine has so far remained stubbornly out of reach, we now understand how to prevent transmission better than ever before. ""A combination of widespread condom use, regular testing for HIV, and getting those with the virus onto the right treatment, could drastically reduce HIV within a generation.""",The world's first clinical trial of an HIV vaccine has begun.,"[""The source text does not state it's the world's first,"", ""The source text doesn't say it is started, but that they're doing recruitment""]",[],0

"The data show subsidence of up to 23cm (9in) as a roughly 20km-long fault ruptured in the Apennine mountains in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Scientists will use the information to better understand what caused the magnitude-6.2 event and to make hazard assessments for the future. Almost 300 people are now known to have died in the big tremor. The worst affected town was Amatrice, but the settlements of Arquata, Accumoli and Pescara del Tronto were also badly hit. The specialised picture displayed at the top of this page is what is known as an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) map. It is made by combining observations of the ground acquired by orbiting satellites ""before"" and ""after"" a quake. The coloured bands, or fringes, represent movement towards or away from the spacecraft. In this case, each fringe is a step of 2.8cm. “The InSAR data show that the earthquake has warped the Earth's surface by a maximum of 23cm, causing subsidence in a 25km-long elongate region roughly between the towns of Norcia and Amatrice,” explained Dr Richard Walters from Durham University, UK, who built the map. “The fault that ruptured was around 20km long. The average slip at depth on the fault was about half a metre, but is concentrated in two major patches, which probably means two separate fault segments ruptured together. “Most slip took place at depth, with only a small amount reaching the surface.” . Dr Walters is affiliated to Britain’s NERC Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET). To make the map, he used radar data from the European Union’s Sentinel-1a and 1b satellites. These spacecraft circle the globe, routinely imaging all land surfaces at least once every six days. Their rapid return to any one location means they were in a position to view central Italy as soon as Friday after the quake, and then again on Saturday. Dr Walters’ point about most of the slip being at depth illustrates the usefulness of InSAR. Not all ruptures will show an obvious surface expression, such as a buckled road or a newly opened fissure in the ground. But the InSAR data, in revealing the scale of warping, still permits scientists to trace the fault involved even if some of its sections are somewhat hidden. This was true of 2009’s damaging quake in L’Aquila, to the south of Amatrice, which killed 309 people. Surface breaks were small and geologists initially had some difficulty in identifying the fault responsible for the magnitude-6.3 event.

"The direct funding scheme for school sport, announced last year, is going to be extended for a further five years. Each year primary schools will continue to receive £8,000, plus £5 per pupil. As well as promoting good health, Mr Cameron says, school sport has an important role in building ""confidence and a sense of achievement"". The funding - the Primary PE and Sport Premium - provides money directly to primary school head teachers, carrying on the sporting legacy of the Olympics. There have also been repeated warnings about childhood obesity and lack of exercise. The funding is meant to improve sports lessons, such as paying for specialist coaching, equipment or to help after-school clubs. It was announced last year as a two-year initiative to run until 2015-16, but Mr Cameron has said he wants to keep this funding for another five years - beyond the general election. ""Sport is so important because it encourages children to be active, lead a healthy lifestyle, make friends and, of course, have fun,"" Mr Cameron said. ""But quality school sport has benefits that spread right across the curriculum and beyond - it develops confidence and a sense of achievement, it teaches young people how to rise to a challenge, and nurtures the character and skills that will help them get on and succeed in life."" Sports presenter Clare Balding said that sport could also help academic results in school.

"Goth Girl author Chris Riddell says in a letter to Justine Greening that many lack investment and need funding via a central government grant. Supported by eight former children's laureates, Riddell is asking Ms Greening to set out required standards. The government said it was up to schools to spend as they saw fit. In his letter, Riddell, supported by authors such as Michael Morpurgo, Jacqueline Wilson and Quentin Blake, said: "" I have seen personally, in my school visits up and down the country, how they promote reading for pleasure and in doing so, turn pupils into avid readers. ""I am deeply concerned that this role is not fully appreciated and, worse, is being undermined through lack of economic and intellectual investment. ""In recent months two major school library services closed in Dorset and Berkshire, and year after year the School Library Association loses members as school library provision shrinks through lack of funding."" He said he had seen how library provision was ""wildly inconsistent"", with great examples of well-funded and staffed libraries. He said the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Libraries had asked the DfE to gather statistics on school library provision so that the extent of this problem could be understood, but this had not yet happened. Riddell also said: ""While schools face insidious pressure on budgets and staff, things cannot change. ""That is why, with the backing of my fellow laureates, I am now calling on Justine Greening and the Department of Education to act on the all-party group's request and then set out clear standards of library provision, and put into place the necessary funding."" This way, every school would have a library service it could be proud of, with books to borrow and, wherever possible, a school librarian to help children choose, he said. A Department for Education official said reading was a key part of a child's education and ultimately helped them to reach their full potential. ""That's why we've strengthened the curriculum to focus on developing their reading and writing skills, and teaching phonics helps children acquire the basic building blocks of reading,"" the official said. ""We want all children to have the opportunity to read widely - school libraries play a role in this, and schools are responsible for deciding how to provide this service for their pupils. ""This is backed up by a record Â£40bn schools budget this year, and it is up schools to spend their funding as they see fit.""",The former children's laureate has written to the education secretary calling for more funding for school libraries in England.,"['the summary added the information about the focus being schools in England, while the source text gives no geographical location ', 'the summary says the letter was written to the education secretary ,while the source text says it was written to the Department of Education', 'intrinsic error being the source text says a group of former children\'s laureates supported the letter, but it does not say the letter writer was a ""former"" laureate himself, he could well be the current laureate.']",[],0

Efforts to capture images of the animals in Iran using camera traps have been unsuccessful so far.

"Police Sgt Nicholas Peacock told Mr Cipriani's trial he ""appeared to be drunk"" when he was brought into Hammersmith police station last June. He was breathalysed and found to be nearly twice the drink-drive limit in June last year, his trial heard. The 28-year-old's defence have argued the case should be thrown out. They told Westminster Magistrates' Court there was a ""lack of evidence"" against the Sale Sharks star, who denies drink-driving in Fulham, west London.

Wallace added: ""It's still a good pitch as Kent's batsmen showed and our batsmen showed at the start of our second innings, so we're very capable of batting out for a draw."" James Kettleborough (52 not out) and Colin Ingram (42 not out) halted Kent's victory march with a stand of 78 after Glamorgan again lost early wickets. Earlier Kent had cruised to 451-2 before declaring just after lunch on day three, with Rob Key hitting 158 and Joe Denly making 161 not out.

"The Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone was elected in 2015 with DUP support. MPs backed a request from the prime minister to hold a snap general election on 8 June by 522 votes to 13. Sinn Féin's northern leader said Mrs May had shown a ""blatant disregard for the people of the north"". Michelle O'Neill said the prime minister's announcement of a general election was about ""the Tory party's self interest"". Meanwhile, the SDLP rejected any suggestion of her party entering a pact with Sinn Féin. DUP MP Ian Paisley said the ""deep frost button"" had been pressed on power-sharing talks in Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley expressed concerns about the future of the talks process during the general election campaign. ""We are seeing the freezer bags come out and the deep frost button being pressed on the Assembly,"" he said. In the last general election, in May 2015, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) agreed pacts in four constituencies, including the UK's most tightly-contested seat of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. That pact helped Mr Elliott take the seat from Sinn Féin's Michelle Gildernew - she had held on to it by just four votes in 2010. On Tuesday, UUP leader Robin Swann said he was ""open"" to discussion on the issue of pacts. Mr Elliott told the BBC on Wednesday it was important that the ""people of Northern Ireland have representation at Westminster"". He also said talks with the DUP would take place in the days ahead to secure the ""best agreement around some constituencies"". Earlier, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party wanted to ""quickly"" arrange talks with the UUP on a potential pact. Sir Jeffrey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the DUP was ""prepared to go further"" this time. ""We recognise that - if Northern Ireland is to maximise its representation and to have a strong voice in the absence of our own government - then we need to return MPs who will actually take their seats at Westminster,"" he said. Sinn Féin currently has four MPs but they do not take their seats in the House of Commons, in protest at British rule in Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey suggested there should be a new unionist pact in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and ""other constituencies as well"". The DUP MP highlighted South Belfast as one constituency where the unionists could gain a seat from nationalists by agreeing to stand a single-unity candidate. The seat is currently held by SDLP MP Dr Alasdair McDonnell. However, there will be no reciprocal deal between nationalist parties, according to Dr McDonnell's colleague, South Down MP Margaret Ritchie. Mrs Ritchie told Good Morning Ulster: ""We don't do electoral pacts"". ""The SDLP fights the election - each and every election - on our own mandate and our own basis,"" she said. Speaking on the same programme, Sinn Féin's national chairperson, Declan Kearney, said his party shared much ""common ground"" with the SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party on issues such as Brexit, equality and the legacy of the Troubles. He said parties opposed to a hard Brexit and austerity policies should work together. ""We'll do our best to maximise the Sinn Féin vote,"" Mr Kearney said. UUP MP Danny Kinahan criticised Sinn Féin abstentionism. ""At the moment, there are four seats where no-one turns up at Westminster and it is the mother of all parliaments,"" he said. The UUP MP admitted that he was ""likely to have a battle with the DUP"" to hold on to his South Antrim seat. He appeared to support a pre-election deal for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and potentially other seats.","UUP leader Tom Elliott has said it is ""important"" that people in Northern Ireland have representation at Westminster.","[""The source text does not mention Elliott's first name"", ""The source text does not mention Elliott's job title.""]",[],0
"Set 238 to win, Pakistan reached their target with 23 balls to spare thanks to Sarfraz Ahmed's unbeaten 101 in Adelaide. Ireland captain William Porterfield earlier made 107, but his wicket triggered a slide to 237 all out. The Irish finish fifth in Pool B, behind West Indies on net run-rate, while Pakistan go on to meet Australia in Adelaide in the last eight on Friday. Before the tournament, Cricket Ireland chief executive Warren Deutrom said it would be a ""failure"" if Porterfield's side did not reach the quarter-finals. But for the third World Cup in succession, the Irish have acquitted themselves well, winning three games and beating two Test-playing sides in West Indies and Zimbabwe. England won only two matches, neither against Test nations. Indeed, Ireland could have reasonably expected to go through with six points, only for their elimination to come as a result of several factors. Heavy losses to South Africa and India damaged their net run rate, West Indies earned three big wins to boost theirs, while Pakistan recovered from two opening defeats to claim four successive victories. This latest win continues the improvement of Misbah-ul-Haq's men, echoing the Pakistan side that began poorly when the tournament was last held in Australia and New Zealand in 1992, only to go and lift the trophy. For Ireland, their creditable showing will be used as evidence by those who say the next World Cup should not be cut from its current 14-team format to only 10 sides. The Irish still have the chance to qualify for that tournament as well as the opportunity to earn Test status through the 2017 Intercontinental Cup. Victory over Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval would have seen them progress past the first round of the World Cup for the second time, but they were unable to take enough runs from a disciplined attack, then lacked the penetration and accuracy to make the chase uncomfortable. Plenty of the Ireland top order got starts, but there was not enough support for Porterfield, who pulled, clipped and drove his way to the highest score made by an associate captain in a World Cup match. However, the collective accuracy of the Pakistan pace attack was impressive and, when left-hander Porterfield miscued Sohail Khan to mid-on, the lower order was exposed. Despite the sluggish nature of the wicket, the Irish regularly found trouble playing the short ball, with the last six wickets falling for 55 runs. Ireland's collection of medium-pacers and spinners may have been able to use the conditions to their advantage, but regular width aided the Pakistan cause. Sarfraz, dropped by wicketkeeper Gary Wilson standing up to Kevin O'Brien on 37, shared an opening stand of 120 with Ahmed Shahzad, whose cut shots benefitted from Irish inaccuracy. When he skied Stuart Thompson to mid-on and Haris Sohail was run-out in a mix-up with Sarfraz, Irish hopes were revived. But Misbah arrived to steady in a stand of 82, taking two sixes over the leg side before treading on his stumps off Alex Cusack with 30 still required. That left the patient Sarfraz to complete his maiden one-day international hundred, with Umar Akmal belting Paul Stirling down the ground to bring Ireland's spirited campaign to a close.

"The 20-year-old hit six fours, showing no ill-effects from the break to the same finger that caused him to leave England's winter tour of India early. Hameed was eventually bowled by seamer Jamie Porter as the visitors reached 319, thanks largely to a counter-attacking 74 from debutant Dale Vilas. Essex were 35-2 in reply at the close. After Lancashire opted to bat first, Hameed, playing after being hurt on the same finger practising against the Cambridge students this week, shared a third-wicket stand of 68 with Liam Livingstone. Steven Croft (48) then gave the visitors' innings impetus, but a flurry of wickets in the afternoon session put Essex in charge as Lancashire were reduced to 160-6. On his Essex debut, former Lancashire paceman Neil Wagner (3-100) and Aaron Beard (3-47) did the damage, along with the run-out of Shivnarine Chanderpaul on 15 by substitute fielder Callum Taylor. South African Kolpak signing Vilas struck 10 boundaries as his 101-ball innings to ensure there was no collapse from the visitors, but their total was still looking a little below par when he was the penultimate batsman out with the total on 268. However, England's James Anderson (13 not out) joined Kyle Jarvis (28) to put on 51 runs in fewer than 10 overs, which frustrated the hosts, taking Lancashire past 300, giving them a third batting point. Essex faced nine overs before stumps and began their reply solidly enough, but Jarvis and Anderson took a late wicket apiece to give their side a slight edge. Essex's former Lancashire paceman Neil Wagner told BBC Radio Essex: . ""It was tough graft out there. It was a pretty unresponsive wicket. It was quite good batting conditions with no cloud or moisture in the air and not much swing. And they played very well. ""It was a wicket where if you gave yourself time it will work for you and Dane Vilas showed that. Once you got in and set on the wicket you could score freely and for long periods of time. ""It was an outstanding delivery by Jamie Porter to remove Haseeb Hameed. He is a batsman who leaves the ball really well and makes good decisions. So it was a pretty good ball. ""Aaron Beard is an outstanding prospect for Essex. I am very excited watching him bowl. I love working with him, he's a good kid. He's still young and the talent and ability he's got at the moment is something to be very excited about."" Lancashire's England opener Haseeb Hameed told BBC Radio Manchester: . ""The finger is fine now. It felt almost back to normal. It was a bit of a freak incident last week, injuring it in the warm-up and it was quite painful when I batted. ""We made the right decision in getting it checked out and thankfully it was all OK. It was the same finger I injured before. I was doing some short-leg practice and trapped it between ball and turf. ""It swelled up quite a lot and became painful. The surgeon has suggested that when there is a bit of time off it might be worth having surgery to take the plate in the finger out. ""I'm looking at the season in very small packages at the moment. It is important for me to just look at the very near future. We've got some important games coming up for Lancs and there is a lot of games to be played for Lancs hopefully before the Test series.

"Car Wheatley, 31, from Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was found guilty of murder at St Albans Crown Court on Wednesday. Alexa-Marie Quinn had 66 injuries including a bruise from her stomach to her ankles when she died last year. Wheatley was told he will have to serve a minimum of 21 years in jail before being considered for release. He had been awarded custody of Alexa-Marie in December 2013 - three months before he killed her. He admitted manslaughter, but the jury rejected his plea of not guilty to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The jury was told Wheatley beat Alexa-Marie with ""hard, sustained, persistent hitting"" after losing his temper. The blows were delivered with such force that fat deposits entered her bloodstream, blocking her lungs, and it was described as the culmination of a period of beatings lasting several weeks. Police found her body on 12 March 2014 and a pathologist said she died from ""extreme blunt-force trauma"". The jury was told that psychiatrists diagnosed Wheatley with multiple mental health disorders. Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan QC said Wheatley dialled 999 on the morning of the fatal attack, but by the time paramedics arrived it was likely Alexa-Marie had been dead for hours. Det Ch Insp Jerome Kent said: ""No child should suffer in this way and it is right that Carl Wheatley, who is a dangerous and violent man, was found guilty of murder and sentenced accordingly."" Adrian Foster, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Without any eyewitnesses, we needed lengthy and highly technical evidence from top medical experts to help provide an explanation as to why this little girl died."" Alexa-Marie had been removed from her mother's care some years earlier and had been living with foster parents in Bedfordshire before moving in with her father. Hertfordshire County Council said there would be an independent review of all the care agencies involved in looking after Alexa-Marie.

"Mr Schleicher, who runs the tests, says the high results of deprived pupils in some Asian countries shows what poor pupils in the UK could achieve. The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK. Mr Schleicher says it ""debunks the myth that poverty is destiny"". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards. The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science. Source: OECD . This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers. But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils. This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries. The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States. In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families. Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France. The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway. The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic. Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated. ""We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,"" he says . There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility. Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries. There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries. ""Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries,"" he said. ""It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world. Policymakers should avoid making such exaggerated claims when discussing this politically sensitive issue.""","Poor pupils in the UK are as good as better-off teenagers in other countries, according to Andreas Schleicher.","['Andreas was not mentioned via a first name, but the last name only.', 'The summary switchs the poor UK students with high performance UK students and vice versa for the other countries.

"The report said cutting the higher rate from 40% to 30% would bring in about £500m extra a year after 10 years. The higher rate is currently paid on annual taxable income of between £43,001 and £150,000. Control over income tax is due to be split between UK and Welsh ministers, once an agreement can be reached. The report, by Prof James Foreman-Peck and Dr Peng Zhou, assumed no change in England's tax rates. Although they predicted tax income in Wales could fall in the first three years after a cut, the authors said receipts should rise in the longer term as high earners find it worthwhile to move from England. ""The encouragement to some households to immigrate, increasing Welsh taxable income, is greater than the revenue lost from the reduction in the rate"", the report said. For the top earners with income of more than £150,000 a year - about one in 100 UK residents - a cut in the additional 45% rate should also boost tax income in Wales, it added. But the report said cutting the basic 20% rate would not boost migration sufficiently to make up for the lost revenue from existing taxpayers in Wales.

"The 17-year-old, who cannot be named, committed the offence while on a community payback order he received for having sex with a 12-year-old girl when he was 14. A court heard that he had sex with the 13-year-old in the grounds of Dundee and Angus College. The meeting was arranged on Snapchat. Dundee Sheriff Court heard how the pair had met through mutual friends in 2015 but there was no contact between them until June 2016 when he added her on the social networking app. Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said that when they met they chatted for some time and the accused was immediately affectionate towards the girl, kissing and cuddling her. ""He told her he had been 'choking to go with her' and they then walked towards the college,"" Ms Robertson said. ""He repeatedly asked her if she would have sex with him, and when in the grounds of the college he said 'have sex with me there' and pointed to a grassy area. ""They went there and had sex, after which he stood up and said he had to leave."" The girl's mother picked her up before the 13-year-old told her what had happened the next day. She then told a counsellor who called in police. The teenager was given a community payback order last year for his previous sex offence conviction. Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told him that custody was the only option this time because he did not appear to have learned from his previous community sentence. The 17-year-old pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act. Defence solicitor Katrina Clark urged the court to impose a second community payback order instead of a jail term. She said: ""He's aware he faces more time in custody. ""The more effective way forward for him would be through the intensive project outlined for him in the social work reports. That wouldn't be an easy option. ""This could be dealt with by a non-custodial sentence due to his age, the period he has spent in custody on remand and his acceptance of his guilt at an early stage."" Sheriff Alastair Carmichael imposed a one-year sentence of detention on the teenager, placed him on the sex offenders register for 10 years and imposed a sexual offences prevention order for six years during which time he will be monitored by specialist police officers. He said: ""Unfortunately from your perspective no other method than custody is appropriate.

"Carl Bildt suggested a ""Yes"" vote would lead to the ""Balkanisation of the British Isles"" and set off ""unforeseen chain reactions"". Mr Salmond said the use of the word ""Balkanisation"" was insulting to the democratic process in Scotland. But a spokesman for Mr Bildt said the politician stood by his comments. The people of Scotland go to the polls on 18 September when they will be asked the ""Yes/No"" question: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" Mr Salmond said the Swede's remarks, made in the Financial Times newspaper, were not only insulting to Scotland but to the Balkan countries that had joined the EU. Both Croatia and Slovenia have become EU member states since the bloody wars that tore Yugoslavia apart in the 1990s. Mr Bildt is a former prime minister of Sweden who also served as the UN's special envoy to the Balkans between 1999 and 2001. The FT quoted him saying that Scottish independence would have ""more profound implications than people think"". He added in the piece: ""The Balkanisation of the British Isles is something we are not looking forward to. It opens up a lot, primarily in Scotland but also in the UK. ""What are the implications for the Irish question?"" he asked. ""What happens in Ulster?"" In a BBC interview, the Mr Salmond took exception to these remarks. He said: ""I think the term Balkanisation was very foolish. ""Insulting to this democratic process in Scotland but also insulting to the new European member states from the Balkans who are now part of the democracy of the European Union."" Slovenia has been in the EU for 10 years and Croatia became the newest member state last year. Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia are all candidates for EU membership. UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, was in Sweden for talks on the future of the EU with other centre-right leaders. At a news conference with Mr Cameron, Swedish Prime Minister, Fredric Reinfeldt, chose not to echo his foreign minister's remarks. He said: ""We also have a lot of experiences in referendums throughout Europe and we have learned to respect the results and not to speculate in advance."" Sweden's shadow foreign minister, Urban Ahlin, said ""unfortunately we have a foreign minister with a specialty in insulting other nations. ""I think he's insulting the people of Scotland by comparing a democratic referendum with 'Balkanisation'."" However, Mr Bildt is said to be standing by his remarks. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, said the comments reflected wider international concern. He explained: ""Balkanisation is not a term that I would use but it's quite clear that leaders across the world are expressing concern about the United Kingdom because the UK is a force for good across the globe."" The SNP often draws inspiration from Scandinavian countries - including Sweden - for its vision of what an independent Scotland could achieve. Mr Bildt is not the only international figure to have commented on Scotland's future in recent days. Last Thursday, the US president Barack Obama said that America had a ""great interest"" in ensuring that the UK remained ""united"". He also stressed that the decision on independence was for Scottish voters. In his BBC interview, the first minister said the remarks were ""low level"" on the Richter scale of presidential interventions. But he appeared to suggest that they could still be counter productive. Mr Salmond said: ""I'm not sure if President Obama is familiar with the Scottish word 'thrawn'. ""It means more than stubborn. It means people don't appreciate being told what to do, I think."" Mr Salmond said the president's comments had come as ""a surprise"" because the US had declared itself ""neutral"" in the referendum campaign. He also noted that the US had previously acknowledged the democratic nature of the Scottish debate. The vote on Scotland's future on September 18th was agreed between the UK and Scottish governments.","Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, has accused Sweden's foreign minister of being ""very foolish"" over comments he made about the Scottish independence referendum.","['The first name of the first minister is does not appear in the source text', 'The summary states that Alex Salmond accused Carl Bildt of being ""very foolish,"" but the text does not say this.

"Real manager Zinedine Zidane has said he cannot guarantee Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema will stay at the Bernabeu this summer. That has prompted reports Manchester United could rekindle their long-standing interest in the 28-year-old. ""It's a ridiculous, stupid story,"" agent Jonathan Barnett told BBC Sport. Bale was hampered by injury last season and lost his place to Isco, but previously flourished under Zidane and was rewarded with a place on the 30-man shortlist for the 2016 Ballon d'Or. However, with Real linked with a 180m euros (£160m) move for 18-year-old Monaco forward Kylian Mbappe, there have been reports that they will look to move on one of Bale, Ronaldo or Benzema. Asked about the trio on Thursday, Zidane said: ""I want everyone who is here now to stay but anything can happen right up until 31 August."" United first tried to sign Bale before he joined Tottenham from Southampton in 2007 and reignited their interest before his move to Spain four years ago. Instead, though, the Welshman joined Real from Tottenham for a then world record fee of £85m. He extended his contract in October 2016, committing him to the Bernabeu club until 2022 and on improved terms reportedly worth £600,000 per week, £350,000 after tax. Despite helping Real win three Champions League titles in four years - scoring in the 2014 final win over rivals Atletico Madrid - Bale's time in Spain has been mixed.

"A report published last month found at least 1,400 children were abused in the South Yorkshire town from 1997 to 2013. Barnardo's Scotland said child sexual exploitation was a ""severe problem"". It has urged government and child protection agencies not to be complacent. The charity said Rotherham should be ""a wake-up call for Scotland"". The Scottish government said it was committed to protecting children and young people's wellbeing. Revelations of child abuse on a massive scale in the English town were revealed in the Jay Report. Now Barnardo's Scotland has published 15 lessons it said must be learned by those involved in protecting children and young people in Scotland. The charity said child sex exploitation (CSE) ""is happening across Scotland"", with two large-scale police operations to identify victims and target perpetrators, one of which, Operation Dash, was ongoing. Barnardo's called for recognition, at every level, that sex between an adult and a child under 16 was always wrong and that it was not the child's responsibility to say 'No'. Martin Crewe, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said: ""We know child sexual exploitation is happening across Scotland. ""We know how devastating it can be. We know charities and support agencies are aware of the problem and are working to put the necessary infrastructure in place to tackle child sexual exploitation. ""But as part of this process, we all need to heed the warning and learn the lessons from Rotherham if we are to be certain that we are all doing our best to protect children from this horrific form of abuse in Scotland."" He added: ""If there is one fundamental lesson from Rotherham it is that we cannot be complacent about child sexual exploitation in Scotland."" Police Scotland said keeping children safe, particularly those who are vulnerable, was top of its list of priorities. As part of Operation Dash, 22 people have been reported to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in relation to a range of crimes. Det Ch Supt Lesley Boal said: ""CSE is a complex challenging and sensitive area of policing. ""Police Scotland works nationally to support the Scottish government's action plan on CSE and we have developed an action plan to compliment this. ""In addition at a local level we have created 14 divisional public protection units that work in partnership with local authorities and health through child protection committees to tackle all forms of child abuse including CSE. ""Within Police Scotland we have a number of specialist units including the National Rape Task Force, the National Human Trafficking Unit and the National Domestic Abuse Task Force that focus on serious sexual crimes."" The Scottish government published updated child protection guidance in May this year. A spokeswoman said: ""Child sexual exploitation is an abhorrent crime and can have devastating impact on victims and their families. ""We established an expert working group to specifically examine child sexual exploitation and this work contributed to our updated guidance. We also work closely with the experts at the Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children (CELCIS) to shape policies and practices to ensure that protection is as rigorous as possible.

"MSPs are studying Scotland's options going forward following the UK's vote to leave the EU. The committee has already reconvened once during the summer recess to take evidence from business leaders and economists. And convenor Joan McAlpine said they had only ""scratched the surface of identifying the true impact"" of Brexit. She appealed for businesses, organisations and individuals from across Scotland to engage with the committee by sending in written submissions or volunteering to give evidence. The committee is looking for views on the alternatives to EU membership and the implications of these on Scotland, how the withdrawal process might be managed at the EU and UK level, the positions likely to be taken by other EU member states and the contribution that EU citizens make to Scotland's economy and society. These views will inform the questions MSPs will put to Scottish and UK government ministers later in the year. Ms McAlpine said: ""Scotland is interconnected with the EU across a number of areas. From people, to investment, students, research and regional development funding to name a few. We need to understand both in the long and short term how Scotland will change as a result of this vote.

"The framework agreement, struck after intensive talks, aims to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon in exchange for phased sanction relief. Iran and the six world powers involved must now finalise the deal. Iranians have been celebrating in the streets but Israel says the deal threatens its survival. ""This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb,"" the US President said in a statement after the deal was announced. ""If Iran cheats, the world will know it,"" he said, adding that the agreement was based not on trust but on ""unprecedented verification"". He said that if the deal is finalised, ""we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully"". According to ""parameters"" of the agreement published by the US state department, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium into a bomb by more than two-thirds. It also has to redesign a power plant so it cannot produce weapons-grade plutonium, be subject to regular inspections, and agree not to enrich uranium over 3.67% - far less than is required to make a nuclear bomb - for at least 15 years. ""There's new state of the art technology that will be used,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry told the BBC. ""We will have tracking of their uranium from the cradle to the grave."" There's been celebration through the night across Iran and a hero's welcome for Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. But the deal he's brought home has been dismissed by hardliners who say Iran surrendered too much in exchange for too little. John Kerry also faces a mix of support and scepticism in the US Congress. The loudest condemnation has come from Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu, who insists this deal doesn't block but helps Iran build a nuclear bomb. As hard as it was to reach this preliminary agreement, it will be even harder to draft a final deal by the end of June. But, if negotiators do it, it will be a victory for diplomacy which, they believe will make the world a much safer place. A deal that buys time . The framework agreement was announced by the European Union and Iran after eight days of intense negotiations in the Swiss city of Lausanne. Western powers have long distrusted Iran's assertions that its nuclear programme is peaceful. The talks at Lausanne's Beau-Rivage Palace hotel between Iran and the so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - continued beyond the original, self-imposed deadline of 31 March. The Iranian foreign minister, Javid Zarif, called it a ""win-win outcome"", but warned: ""We have taken a major step, but are still some way away from where we want to be."" The parties have set a deadline of 30 June to reach a comprehensive pact, but these negotiations are expected to be tougher than those that led to the framework agreement. Even so, there was jubilation overnight on the streets of Tehran. If the deal is implemented it should mean the eventual lifting of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. Unusually, the US President's speech was aired live on Iranian state television, with some Iranians taking ""selfies"" with Mr Obama as a backdrop. There was anger though from Israel, whose leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been a vocal critic of Iran and told President Obama the deal threatened the survival of Israel. The Israeli prime minister said it would ""increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and the risks of a horrific war"", according to his spokesman. In the US, the deal has been criticised by members of Congress who want US lawmakers to have the right to review any final agreement.

Opera, theatre and dance companies, as well as educational groups and arts centres, will be finding out about their proposed budgets for 2016/17. The funding announcement is the final stage of ACW's investment review, the first in five years.

"The questions were answered by 131 leaders, out of 253 new Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). A third said they felt under pressure to become larger, and two-thirds expressed fears that they might inherit debt. The Department of Health said it expected parts of the NHS to work together to resolve any deficits. The survey was organised by NHS Alliance and the National Association of Primary Care, which have joined forces to represent CCGs, who will take over buying and organising NHS services. 36% of GPs and other leaders who responded to the survey said they were under pressure from NHS managers to become bigger, so they could pass a viability test next month. And 67% suspect they will have to deal with some legacy debt from former primary care trusts (PCTs) when the new system begins in England in April 2013. Dr Michael Dixon, who heads the NHS Alliance, said: ""Having a board with other clinical representatives and allowing for audit will be expensive. ""So the CCGs need to reach a critical mass in terms of size. But there's a risk of ending up recreating the old system of 150 primary care trusts. ""We're very concerned about the possibility of debts. My GP leaders don't want to be in the position of decommissioning services. ""It's been accepted that the CCGs shouldn't inherit deficits. But in practical terms, the squeeze on NHS finances is greater than people realise. ""Savings can be made in reducing referrals by GPs - but that won't achieve all the efficiencies that are needed. ""So there's concern not just about deficits but also the ongoing savings that are needed - and whether the CCGs will have sufficient budgets. It could be a double whammy."" Dr Dixon defended the idea of GPs taking a more active role in rationing treatment under the new system. He said: ""The NHS isn't some sort of soup kitchen where everyone can just pile in. ""GPs have always had to be responsible for the use of NHS resources, and to think about balancing them against the greater good. ""People are presenting this as a brave new world - but it's something we're doing anyway. ""Rationing is the duty of every patient, commissioner and manager - or we won't have a sustainable NHS."" Dr Dixon said though that he agreed with the British Medical Association that GPs should not receive bonuses for saving money. A Department of Health spokesman denied officials were being prescriptive about the size of CCGs. He said: ""There are widespread variations in the size and population coverage of PCTs and there is no single 'right' size."" ""CCGs will not be responsible for PCT debt that arose before this current financial year. ""During 2011/12 and 2012/13, we expect PCT clusters, PCTs and developing CCGs to work together to resolve PCT deficits.""","More than half of GPs and other NHS leaders in England say they fear they will have to deal with legacy debt, a survey suggests.",['The summary incorrectly includes NHS leaders in the survey results'],[],0

"The Kyrgyz National Security Committee (GKNB) named the prime suspect as Akbarzhon Jalilov, a 22-year-old with Russian citizenship, born in the Kyrgyz city of Osh in 1995. He is thought to be among the dead. The hunt is on for possible accomplices. Russian officials suspect that he had links to so-called Islamic State (IS). So far few details have emerged about Jalilov. There are unconfirmed reports that he was an ethnic Uzbek. Russia's State Investigative Committee said ""an explosive device could have been detonated by a man whose body parts were found in the third carriage of the train."" ""The man has been identified but his identity will not be disclosed for now in the interests of the investigation,"" the statement added. The bomb blew up in a train carriage which had just left Sennaya Ploshchad station. The driver managed to continue to Tekhnologichesky Institut station. Later a similar device was found propped up against a wall at another city metro station, Ploshchad Vosstaniya. The Russian news website Gazeta.ru reports that the bombs were concealed in car fire extinguishers, with ball bearings taped to the outside. The one which exploded is said to have been carried in a rucksack. Reports say Jalilov had been living in St Petersburg for six years and had used several passports. He had worked as a chef in a St Petersburg sushi restaurant, Gazeta reported. Kyrgyz investigators are working with Russian authorities on the case. Reuters news agency spoke to people in Osh who said Jalilov was from an ethnic Uzbek family. They said they knew his parents but had not seen him for years. They said his father worked as a panel-beater in a car repair shop. IS has recruited many Islamist militants from Central Asian republics and from Chechnya in the North Caucasus. Russian aircraft and cruise missiles have targeted IS and other rebel groups in Syria - a vital intervention for embattled Syrian government forces. Osh - Kyrgyzstan's second-largest city - was the scene of inter-ethnic clashes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in June 2010, in which hundreds of people died.

"Armstrong was stripped of his yellow jerseys for doping by cycling's governing body on Monday. ""The management committee decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events,"" said a UCI statement. American Armstrong crossed the line first every year between 1999 and 2005. The UCI acknowledged that ""a cloud of suspicion would remain hanging over this dark period - but that while this might appear harsh for those who rode clean, they would understand there was little honour to be gained in reallocating places"". The body has also ordered Armstrong and others to pay back all prize money from this period, and has commissioned an independent investigation into the whole Armstrong affair. Pending the results of the report, defamation proceedings against Paul Kimmage, a former cyclist and Sunday Times journalist, have been suspended. The statement added: ""The committee agreed that part of the independent commission's remit would be to find ways to ensure that persons caught for doping were no longer able to take part in the sport, including as part of an entourage."" Armstrong, 41, and his United States Postal Service team ran ""the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen"", a 1,000-page United States Anti-Doping Agency report concluded. In the report, it was also claimed that Armstrong paid the UCI $100,000 (£62,300) for the fight against anti-doping. Floyd Landis, a former colleague of Armstrong's who now admits to using drugs, claims this was hush money to cover up a positive test for the banned substance EPO that was collected from Armstrong during his victory at the Tour of Switzerland in 2001. The UCI admitted it received money from Armstrong in 2002, but said in 2010 that this was not part of a cover-up. BBC Sport understands that at Friday's UCI management committee hearing there was an attempt by more than one member to force honorary president Hein Verbruggen to resign, but it did not gain enough support and failed. Verbruggen and president Pat McQuaid, who has been asked to resign in an open letter by America's three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond, have come under intense pressure to stand aside in the wake of the Armstrong scandal. There was no attempt to get McQuaid to quit. McQuaid said the governing body are ""determined to turn around this painful episode in the history of our sport"".

Scotland is aiming to generate the equivalent of 100% of its electricity needs from renewables by 2020. The UK Department of Energy and Climate Change also issued revised statistics for 2011 which showed that renewable electricity generation in Scotland was 13,735 GWh in 2011, an increase of 44.3% from 2010 and up 97.3% from 2006. The Scottish government said that, assuming gross consumption in 2011 was similar to 2010, about 35% of Scotland's electricity needs came from renewables in 2011, beating its interim target of 31%. Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said the figures showed the country was making good progress towards the 2020 target.

"Mr Hands said officials would be able to choose the type of products to be covered by agreements. The union operates alongside the EU's single market and free trade area. It comes after the Brexit secretary said the UK would consider paying for ""best possible"" single market access. The customs union includes all 28 EU nations, but also Turkey, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra and non-EU UK territories such as the Channel Islands. They enjoy free trade with each other, but must impose the same tariffs on goods from nations outside the pact and are barred from doing bilateral trade deals with other countries. Bloomberg news agency published remarks Mr Hands made in an interview this week in which he said the ""history of international trade has got all kinds of examples of customs unions"". He said the UK could be selective about which individual sectors it wished to be covered by any customs union arrangement. Mr Hands added: ""You can choose which markets, which products the customs unions affect and which they don't, so there isn't a binary thing of being inside the customs union or outside of the customs union."" As the pound posted its fifth consecutive week of gains against the euro, Mr Hands's words were cited by financial market commentators as further evidence that fears over a ""hard Brexit"" were easing. In the Commons on Thursday, Brexit Secretary David Davis had said the ""major criterion"" was getting the best access for goods and services to the European market. Later, in a speech to CBI Wales in Cardiff, Mr Davis sought to reassure business leaders that immigration controls after Brexit will not be imposed ""in a way that it is contrary to the national and economic interest"". But Brexit-backing Tory MP Peter Bone said ""people would be absolutely outraged"" if the UK continued to pay the EU after Brexit. And another prominent Leave campaigner and former Conservative cabinet minister, Iain Duncan Smith, told the BBC he believed Mr Davis had been simply not ruling anything in or out of the government's Brexit negotiations.","The UK could remain inside the EU's customs union after it leaves the bloc, Treasury minister Greg Hands has said.","[""The summary adds Mr Hands' full name which is not in the source text"", ""The summary adds Mr Hands' job title which is not in the source text"", ""The summary states that the UK could remain inside the EU's customs union, but the text does not state this.

"Chris Murphy was granted leave to pursue a judicial review of the A6 upgrade. It is the first stage in a bid to halt the Â£160m dual carriageway because of concerns over the impact on wildlife in and around Lough Neagh and Lough Beg. A judge has ruled the challenge should proceed to a full hearing in 2017. The A6 is the main Belfast to Londonderry road and is heavily used. Mr Murphy, an ornithologist, was granted leave in the High Court to seek a judicial review over an alleged breach of a directive on a specially protected area close to a section of the Toome to Castledawson stretch of the upgrade. The A6 upgrade would also run through a landscape made famous by Heaney including an area near Mossbawn, County Londonderry, the former Nobel laureate's childhood home. Mr Murphy said Heaney's work was fundamental to the area's landscape. ""The wild and the wet inspired him and he immortalised it in his work,"" he said. ""You have got dozens of places in his poetry that will be destroyed by the impact of the noise of a motorway so close to Mossbawn"". The environmentalist issued proceedings after the upgrade was given the go ahead by Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard. At Thursday's hearing, a judge said there was still uncertainty surrounding checks to determine the disturbance to wildlife in and around Lough Neagh and Lough Beg. The judge held that an arguable case has been established on an alleged breach of the habitats directive that gives protected status to both Loughs. He noted that further assessments have been carried out since the department first made checks on the presence of nesting birds, badgers and bats, and to ensure minimisation of disturbance to whooper swans. But the judge said he was unclear whether these actions were part of a fulfilment of the habitats directive obligations. ""The court is left wondering about the impact or otherwise of the checks being carried out,"" he said. The judge said that any concerns may be eased once further information is supplied. However, he ruled that the challenge should proceed to a full hearing early next year. ""There's substantial public interest involved in a case like this,"" he said. ""Stopping a major road project is a matter of considerable importance."" The disputed route for the dual carriageway was identified following a public inquiry nearly a decade ago.","A landscape made famous by poet Seamus Heaney could be destroyed by a major road upgrade, a environmentalist has claimed.","[""Heaney's first name was not mentioned at all.""]",[],0

The Discovery Museum exhibition explores the fair's history and the lives of the travelling showmen. Visitors will also be able to play on vintage slot machines. The gathering began as a Temperance Fair in 1882, in what was seen as an antidote to the Newcastle Races which had, up to then, been held on the Town Moor.

"This Central American nation has often been in the middle of events with an impact far beyond its borders, from the engineering marvel that is the Panama Canal to the country's many political storms. Even so, people here have reacted with surprise - and indignation - after seeing their country's name linked to a hashtag that is shaking the world. For many locals, to talk about #PanamaPapers is in itself an injustice, as the name tarnishes the whole country with an alleged complicity in international tax evasion. They claim the accusations should instead be directed at a minuscule segment of their society. And anyway, they insist, the Panamanian companies involved were not doing anything different to firms in other financial capitals across the world. Panama is indeed a large and sophisticated offshore financial centre, whose companies help manage, in one way or another, large fortunes from all corners of the planet. But how does all of that money impact the everyday life of normal Panamanians? For a visitor, the prosperity of parts of the country is evident from the moment the plane flies over the capital, affording the first glimpse of Panama City from above. The city centre is so ostentatious that a Trump luxury hotel tower, 284 metres high and until 2012 the tallest building in Latin America, goes almost unnoticed among the dozens of skyscrapers crowding the horizon. Some people say it reminds them of Dubai, others say it looks like Miami. Panama City has done a good job in attracting cash to the country, home to just four million people and with relatively few natural resources other than its geographic location. The financial sector is key to the country's wealth, representing around 7% of GDP. And in a business where reputation is everything, many fear the effect the scandal could have on the industry's future growth. But Rafael, the taxi driver who takes me from the airport into the city centre, does not necessarily see it as his problem. He views it as a quarrel among elites. ""It is a white people's dance,"" he says disdainfully. He will not give me his full name, objecting that ""you never know who you are talking to"". But after a few minutes of conversation, he acknowledges his own life has been closely affected by the financial industry's ups and downs. He says he worked with one of the many Western banks that came to Panama during the 1970s boom, when Latin America was awash in petrodollars and the country helped manage many of the region's fortunes. But in the 1980s the petrodollars vanished. Panama was stigmatised as a money laundering centre for drug cartels, the bank left, and he ended up without a job. The financial sector eventually recovered and is now a central part of the economy, together with the Panama Canal, helping the country become more prosperous than most of its neighbours. With this wellbeing threatened, it is no wonder that political and business leaders in Panama treat the scandal as little less than an act of foreign aggression against the nation. La Estrella, one of the main local newspapers, carried a front page headline claiming that ""The Panama Papers are a global attack against the financial system"". ""The criticism Panama is getting is unfair. It is media sensationalism,"" Gian Castillero, an adviser to the foreign ministry, says. This week's revelations on the mechanisms used by the rich and famous to hide their fortunes refer to multiple jurisdictions, he claims, but the world is only focusing on one: Panama. ""There is no supervision problem in the government of Panama,"" he insists, adding that the country has submitted to several international benchmarking processes on its standards. ""There is a commitment to transparency."" On social media, some Panamanians have undertaken a likely quixotic crusade to change the #PanamaPapers hashtag to one that is less compromising of their country's reputation.",The Panama Papers scandal is not the first time Panama has been in the news.,"['The summary implies that Panama has often been in the news, but the source text does not discuss repeated media attention specifically.']",[],0
"Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, is charged with murder, attempted murder, possession of a weapon and intimidation. During his brief appearance, he shouted slogans such as: ""You call it terrorism. I call it patriotism."" He could also be heard shouting ""Death to the enemies of America"". ""Leave this country if you hate our freedom - death to antifa,"" he said, using a common abbreviation for the anti-fascist movement. He did not enter a plea to the charges and is due to appear in court again on 7 June. President Donald Trump has tweeted that last week's attack was ""unacceptable"". Portland's mayor is meanwhile trying to ban a forthcoming right-wing rally in the West Coast city. The attack unfolded on Friday afternoon after the suspect began spewing ""hate speech"" towards two young women on a train, police said. Taliesin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Ricky Best, 53, intervened and were fatally stabbed at the Hollywood Transit Center train station, said investigators. Another man, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, was slashed in the neck and is recovering. He was in court on Tuesday to see Jeremy Joseph Christian's appearance. Destinee Mangum, 16, said she had been with a friend wearing a hijab on the first night of Ramadan - Islam's holiest month - when the suspect targeted them. ""He told us to go back to Saudi Arabia, and he told us we shouldn't be here, to get out of his country,"" she told KPTV-TV. ""He was just telling us that we basically weren't anything and that we should kill ourselves."" The mother of Namkai-Meche, Asha Deliverance, took to Facebook to write an open letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to ""take action"". ""Your words and actions are meaningful, here in America and throughout the world,"" she wrote. ""Please encourage all Americans to protect and watch out for one another. Please condemn any acts of violence, which result directly from hate speech & hate groups. ""I am praying you will use your leadership to do so."" Detectives say they are investigating Mr Christian's background of extremist ideology. At a ""Free Speech"" rally in Portland on 29 April, police confiscated a baseball bat he had allegedly been using to threaten liberal protesters. Mr Christian was later filmed performing a Nazi salute, and shouting racial epithets while wearing an American flag as a cape. On his Facebook page he has praised Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and posted a death threat against Hillary Clinton. And he wrote: ""If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS"". Mr Christian has also voiced support for Senator Bernie Sanders, the Wall Street-bashing, 2016 Democratic presidential candidate. According to the Oregonian newspaper, Mr Christian pleaded guilty in 2002 to robbing and kidnapping the owner of a store. In 2010 he was charged with theft and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Mayor Ted Wheeler said he welcomed the president's tweet on Monday condemning the attack. But he urged the federal government to revoke a permit for a ""Trump Free Speech Rally"" scheduled for this weekend in Portland. He said the organisers are ""coming to peddle a message of hatred"" and that hate speech is not protected by the US constitution. A Facebook page for the event says there will be speakers and live music in ""one of the most liberal areas on the West Coast"", and thanks Mr Trump ""for all you have done"". Mayor Wheeler also asked the federal government to deny a permit for a ""March Against Shariah"" planned in Portland for 10 June. ""Our City is in mourning, our community's anger is real, and the timing and subject of these events can only exacerbate an already difficult situation"", said the city leader. The American Civil Liberties Union defended the rallies, saying in a series of tweets that ""the government cannot revoke or deny a permit based on the viewpoint of the demonstrators. Period"".

"Concerned that their messages may be intercepted, the leadership has also banned members from using smart phones. The group has long run what is regarded as a slick media machine. Even without smart phones, it has been known for its sophisticated handling of social media, a reputation at odds with its regular bans on communication technology for Somali citizens. In particular, it has made extensive use of Twitter in order to get its message across. It has also devoted considerable resources to producing a series of promotional videos. Al-Shabab's material aims to spread the group's ideology of establishing an Islamic state in Somalia, in line with al-Qaeda's stated ambition of setting up a global Islamic caliphate. It wants to achieve this both by military conquest and also the conversion of souls - for which communication technology is a key tool. Al-Shabab's well-produced video documentaries deliver the jihadi narrative in an appealing form to Somali audiences in the diaspora. They are aimed at young people of Somali origin such as Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a suspect in last year's Westgate mall attack in Kenya. His family is said to have moved to Norway as refugees in 1999. The group's documentaries are produced by its media arm, the al-Kataib foundation. Many of them show al-Shabab engaging in charity work and other activities that depict the group as a legitimate authority. However, they can also be quite gruesome - showing the corpses of those they have killed, including alleged spies who are often beheaded. And they contain threats to their perceived enemies - in Somalia, neighbouring countries such as Kenya which are helping Somalia's government and the West. The videos portray al-Shabab's fight as part of a wider global conflict in which Islam is under threat. Al-Shabab also has its own radio station, Radio Andalus. The group has acquired half a dozen relay stations, mainly by seizing private radio stations such as HornAfrik, Holy Koran Radio and the Global Broadcasting Corporation radio and their equipment - including some from the BBC. The website Kismaayo News reported that by 2013, the group had 50 journalists working for Andalus radio. When it comes to recruiting presenters, al-Shabab is known for its attention to detail. It generally takes care to use presenters with British or American accents to deliver its English language audio statements.

Swahili-language presenters use classical Kiswahili as spoken in Tanzania and coastal Kenya. The majority of al-Shabab's audio output, though, is in Somali and is presented articulately and fluently. A number of pro-al-Shabab websites have emerged, which host material produced by the group and act as vehicles for furthering its military aims. The content is intended to frustrate efforts by the Somali government and its allies - mainly the African Union forces fighting in Somalia - to eliminate the group. Al-Shabab has often used Twitter to challenge the veracity of claims made by the African Union forces. Its Twitter accounts are now closed, but Kenya's military spokesman Maj-Gen Chirchir has continued to attack the group's media policy. On 20 May he tweeted: ""Al Shabaab Courtesy calls! The more videos you release to scare Kenyans the more WE make visitations. Consider peace, the better option."" When the group's official spokesman, Sheikh Ali Dheere, appears on video, he is surrounded by fighters. He reportedly answers to the group's overall leader and oversees a bevy of apparently enthusiastic journalists. Al-Shabab has honed its media strategy as aggressively as it has enforced its bans on the Somali population. As the group loses control of parts of the country, it has issued a series of bans on technology: . BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

"They were allegedly subject to sexual abuse and forced to beg on the streets. The owner, Rosa del Carmen Verduzco, and eight employees at the House of the Big Family have been arrested. Correspondents say it is one of Mexico's worst incidents of alleged child abuse at a children's institution in many years. The government said the building was home to 278 boys, 174 girls and six infants under the age of three. Also rescued were 138 adults aged up to 40, the government said. Reports say the residents were forced to live in terrible conditions. ""I'm in utter dismay because we weren't expecting the conditions we found at the group home,"" Michoacan Governor Salvador Jara said. The House of the Big Family has been operating for 40 years and was known locally as Mama Rosa's Home. The authorities began to investigate the home after parents complained that they were denied access to their children. One woman, who grew up at the home herself, gave birth to two children who were registered in the name of Ms Verduzco. When the mother left the home, aged 31, she was not allowed to take her children with her, investigators said. Mr Jara said the raid came after an official complaint was filed by the parents of five children who said they were being held at the home against their will. He said the complaint was filed more than a year ago, but did not specify why the authorities had not acted sooner. Local media had reported on allegations made against the home as far back as 2010. By Will Grant, BBC Mundo, Mexico City . Mexicans are waking up to the news with a sense of shock and disbelief - mainly at the sheer scale of the alleged abuse at Casa Mama Rosa. The list of accusations is long and serious: almost 500 children held against their will and sent into the streets to beg, their parents prevented fromt them, sexual and psychological abuse at what is a well-known and often praised children's home. As such, this certainly stands out from other stories of abuse in Mexican institutions and has sparked some uncomfortable questions. How long were the authorities aware of the accusations before they acted? Were corrupt officials involved in keeping those accusations silent? Meanwhile Rosa Verduzco herself is under arrest and facing a range of charges including sexual abuse and mistreatment of children. But over the 40 years she has been running the home, she has gained some influential and high-profile supporters, among them the renowned Mexican writer Enrique Krauze, who took to Twitter to defend her record. An article in newspaper El Universal said six families had alleged that Ms Verduzco refused to hand over their children to them. One mother told Universal reporters that she had taken her son to the home after a social worker had recommended it as a place for her child to get treatment for hyperactivity. The mother, Martha Ines Lopez Ramirez, said she was only allowed to see her son once every four months and only ever in the presence of a ""guard"". Ms Lopez said that her son seemed to have been drugged and showed signs of having been beaten. She told El Universal that all parents had been made to hand over custody of the children to Ms Verduzco, and sign a written agreement not to retrieve the children before they turned 18. El Universal quoted Ms Verduzco at the time as saying that most of the children came from ""dysfunctional families"". She told the reporters that the home was indeed ""reluctant"" to release children back to their families ""unless the parents could demonstrate there had been an improvement in the family's condition"". A child welfare specialist consulted by the newspaper in 2010 said the allegations of mistreatment went back two decades but that Ms Verduzco was ""politically well connected"".",More than 500 children have been rescued from a group home in the western Mexican state of Michoacan.,"['The source text does not say that Michoacan is in western Mexico.', 'The summary says more than 500 children were rescued, but according to the information in the text is was less than 500.']",[],0
"Hain, the top run-scorer in last year's competition, helped his side reach their revised target of 159 in a game reduced to 30 overs. He was aided by Will Porterfield's 63 in an unbroken first-wicket stand. Northants struggled to 154 all out in their 30 overs, with Rob Keogh (64) the only one to make a real impression. England international Ben Duckett was caught by Hain for seven off the bowling of Rikki Clarke (2-18), one of seven Northants batsmen to fail to get out of single figures as Oliver Hannon-Dalby (3-24) impressed. Hain returned to the side having been left out of their previous County Championship game, on the day he received a reprimand from the ECB's Cricket Discipline Commission. He was reported by the umpires during Warwickshire's Second XI Championship match against Worcestershire at Flagge Meadow last week, for a Level One breach of the code (bowling a fast short pitched ball and/or accidental high full pitched ball that results in the bowler being disallowed from bowling any further in that innings). The penalty is a reprimand, which will remain on his record for two years. The accumulation of nine or more penalty points in any two-year period will result in an automatic suspension. Hain scored more runs in the One-Day Cup last season than any other batsman (540 in 10 innings). Northants coach David Ripley told BBC Radio Northampton: . ""We just haven't come out of the blocks at all. We've been very well beaten. It's a pretty grim effort all round really. ""We had the sharp end of the conditions batting first, we had to stop start and couldn't get any partnerships together. But still our performance is way down from where we expect it to be. ""I expected our bowlers to be a handful and I was hopeful we could pull off something special but we never got started with the ball either."" Warwickshire batsman Sam Hain told BBC WM: . ""I felt a bit of pressure coming into this competition so it's nice to get on the board here with a few runs. ""Especially after the start to my season in the red-ball game. I'm a little stumped to why it hasn't happened in the Championship.

"Initial Environment Agency figures showed £86,000 was spent on a wildlife survey and putting the animals in winter storage at a cost of £24,000. But the latest figures show the total cost was higher - working out at £2,454 per vole. The agency said it had a duty to move the legally protected species. 'Feel vibrations' Previously, the agency said the wildlife survey was not part of the cost of relocating the voles. But the BBC has since learned the cost of setting up traps along the river banks and checking them over a period of several months was not previously disclosed. Farmer James Winslade said when annual dredging took place before the agency took over, it had not appeared to affect the vole population. ""They're not stupid, they'll feel the vibration and move on - it's not like they haven't any other habitat to move on to,"" he said. ""The riverbank adjoins fields so they can move from the riverbanks to the fields."" Money spent on relocating the voles was a small percentage of the £6m spent on dredging five miles (8 km) of the rivers Tone and Parrett, the agency said previously. The voles spent the winter in an ""over-wintering facility"" before being moved to Hampshire and Cornwall, according to the figures. Ecology expert Graeme Skinner said the work required professional, academically-trained people ""who hold relevant licences"". ""They are undertaking sometimes long, arduous hours in the field to make sure it's up to the standard that is required nowadays,"" he said.","The cost of relocating more than 100 voles from the banks of the Tone and Parrett rivers has risen to more than £120,000.","[""The summary indicates that more than 100 voles were relocated but the source text doesn't indicate the number of voles"", ""As far as the total cost, the source text indicates a cost of at least £86,000 (survey) + £24,000 (relocation) = £110,000 and a cost of £2,454 per vole but doesn't specify the total number of voles relocated.

"The speech built on her article in The Times on Monday and is important for a number of reasons - not least its attempt to marry a general and widespread disillusion among the public that the economy ""is not working for them"" with a sense that the Conservative Party's driving philosophy is about more than free markets. The first of these is straight from the playbook of Mr Miliband; the second is from Lady Thatcher. Here's Mr Miliband at the time of the 2011 Labour Party conference where he announced plans to rein in ""excessive pay"". ""This is not an anti-business message, this is an anti-business as usual message,"" he told the Today programme. And here's Mrs May today, on her plans to tackle the ""unhealthy and growing gap"" between what she deliberately describes as ""bosses"" and ""workers"". ""It is not anti-business to suggest that big business needs to change,"" she said. Now, of course Mrs May would be likely to splutter into her morning cup of tea if there was any suggestion that Mr Miliband was guiding her politically. As she said in her speech this morning, the Home Secretary believes that Labour's approach to ""equality"" holds people back. And she insisted the Conservatives remained the party of enterprise. But Mrs May's pledges to put worker representatives on company boards (as well as ""consumers""), to make shareholder votes on executive remuneration binding, to oblige companies to publish data on the pay multiple between a company's chief executive and the pay of the average worker, to have a ""proper industrial strategy"" that could be used to block takeovers such as Pfizer's attempt to buy AstraZeneca - all are certainly a substantial attempt to build the broadest of Tory tents. Further, they are a deliberate economic pitch for the centre ground of politics, to a level of detail many will be surprised by. Anyone who thought that a Conservative-led administration under Mrs May would not be interventionist when it comes to economic and business policy will certainly have to reconsider. Mrs May even had some words for policy makers at the Bank of England, saying that ultra-low interest rates had helped home owners over those struggling to clamber on the housing ladder. So, where does Lady Thatcher fit in? Rather more subtly, but still distinctly, in the line: ""We don't just believe in markets, but in communities."" Lady Thatcher was clear on her distrust of ""big state"" solutions and spoke regularly of communities of people, even ""society"" despite the oft-quoted line that there was ""no such thing"". She said that people should be allowed to get on and should prosper, as long as they played by the rules. Mrs May appears to be echoing the sentiment, replacing the ""big state"" with ""big business"" and ""vested interests"". She vowed to take them on, tying a reformist line directly from Robert Peel to Joseph Chamberlain to Lady Thatcher. Mrs May also spoke of ""leading on behalf of the people"". Many argue that Brexit uncertainty will make the fortunes of the UK economy over the coming months and years difficult to forecast. Mrs May, launching herself as the UK's next prime minister, appears to want to be tested on whether that economy is seen as working for everyone.",Home Secretary Theresa May's speech to the Conservative conference this morning is an important moment for the Conservative Party.,"[""The summary makes up May's first name"", 'The summary states that the speech was given at the Conservative conference, but the text does not mention that the speech took place at the Conservative conference.']",[],0

It comes after officials in Ukraine arrested a Frenchman apparently inspired by extremist right-wing beliefs to plot a series of attacks. In his car he was carrying two rocket launchers, explosives, detonators, five Kalashnikovs and 5,000 rounds of ammunition, intelligence officials said.

Move 'to shut Paris Euro 2016 fan zone' Commander Dean Haydon, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terror squad, said they were working with French police and security and intelligence agencies across the world to establish whether there was a threat to the Euros. ""We have seen propaganda, Islamic State (IS) and potential talk of plots against the Euros, but we're working with all those various different agencies to police and make the Euros a safe event and a safe games,"" he said. ""Although the ultimate policing of the event and the planning is for the French, we are all involved in properly trying to understand the threat, if there is one."" French ambassador to to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, said her country was well-prepared. Last November, 130 people were killed in Paris when gunmen and suicide bombers linked to IS attacked the Bataclan concert hall, restaurants and bars, and the Stade de France. Three explosions occurred outside the Stade de France stadium on the northern fringe of Paris where France were playing Germany in an international football friendly. One bomber and a passer-by were killed. Earlier in the year, two gunmen killed 12 people in an attack on the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A further five people were killed when a third attacker took a Jewish supermarket hostage.

"Latest figures released by EMAS reveal it has a £8.74m deficit - 20 times higher than predicted. The NHS Trust Development Authority, which monitors trusts, said it was working closely with the service to help address financial pressures. EMAS said it has spent more on extra vehicles, staff, training and overtime payments. It had predicted an overspend of about £500,000 at the start of the year. The money problems at EMAS are getting worse. One of the biggest problems is handover delays to A&E because they're too busy to accept patients straight away. So far this year, more than 10,000 patients have had to wait more than an hour and because the ambulance service gets paid for each patient it takes to hospital, they are losing out. Also the NHS would like to treat more people at home, but of course it is a financial disincentive. Our busiest A&E department at Leicester Royal Infirmary is trying to sort it out, but I don't think there's any quick fix. EMAS claims it is owed £2.6m in compensation for the handover delays, which has contributed to the overspend. The deficit could rise as demand for the emergency service traditionally increases in January and February. Richard Wheeler, director of finance of EMAS, said: ""The challenges we face come with an increase in cost, including cost of training and upskilling our frontline staff, given the national shortage in paramedics. ""[Also an] increased cost in providing additional staff and vehicles to cover for staff delayed at hospitals, and also extra payments for shifts which don't finish on time.

"It was played by band leader Wallace Hartley, who died along with 1,517 others as the ship went down. It had a guide price of £300,000. The BBC's Duncan Kennedy said the buyer was believed to be British. Auctioneer Alan Aldridge said the violin was the ""rarest and most iconic"" piece of Titanic memorabilia. Many of the other items up for sale, such as photographs, newspapers and crockery, were sold for between £10 and a few hundred pounds. By Duncan KennedyBBC News . What would Wallace Hartley have made of it all? Well, the modest, jobbing, musician from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, would probably not have believed it. His violin, given to him by his fiancee, Maria, as an engagement present, going at auction for £900,000 (just over £1m when you add in buyers premium and VAT). He'd only just got off the RMS Mauretania when his agent asked him if he wanted to go straight onto another voyage, the Titanic. Hartley agreed, a move that would cost him his life but also create a legend. There were gasps at the auction when the bidding passed half a million pounds. But it kept climbing, the bidders in the room soon over taken by the serious money on the phones. Any suggestion the violin wasn't authentic, as some have claimed, was swept away in a torrent of successively higher bids. In the end, it beat the old world record for a single Titanic item four times over. Played by a man who personifies a bygone era of high morals and values, it's more than just a violin, it's an instrument of history. Mr Aldridge set the bidding at £50 for the violin, which was lot 230 of 251, so ""two of his friends could bid"" - but after just a couple of minutes it had passed £100,000. It eventually sold for £900,000 after fierce bidding between two telephone bidders. Hartley has become part of the ship's legend after leading his fellow musicians in playing as the vessel sank. They are famously said to have played the hymn Nearer My God To Thee. It had taken seven years for the Devizes auction house, Henry Aldridge & Son, to authenticate the instrument. Several experts were used, including forensic scientists who said the wood still contained salt deposits from the sea water. Some people still doubt whether the violin is the genuine article, however, and believe it could not have survived being submerged in the sea. But it is claimed the violin survived in a leather case strapped to Mr Harley's body who was found wearing his cork and linen lifejacket. A diary entry by his fiancee, Maria Robinson, said it was saved from the water and returned to her. Following her death in 1939, the violin was given to her local Salvation Army citadel and was later passed on to the current anonymous owner's mother in the early 1940s. The auction house said it had attracted interest from collectors all over the world and added that more than 315,000 people viewed it during a three-month exhibition in the United States. The most money previously paid for a piece of Titanic memorabilia is thought to have been a plan of the ship used in the 1912 inquiry into the sinking. This was bought by a private collector at auction for £220,000 in 2011.","A violin believed to have been played on the Titanic has been sold for £900,000 at auction in Wiltshire.",['No mention of Wiltshire or the location of the auction in the source text'],[],0
"It says the new rule would apply in cases of ""repeated instances of the most serious and deliberate breaches of their licence conditions"". The party claims their pledged action would protect consumer interests. But the current regulator, Ofgem, said it already had the power to remove licences from energy firms in certain circumstances. ""Where firms fail to meet standards there must be tough and decisive action,"" said Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary. Labour has already promised to abolish Ofgem, and put a new regulator in place. An Ofgem spokesman said it already had powers to revoke licences in ""specific circumstances, including where companies have failed to comply with particular enforcement orders."" However, a Labour spokesman said the current rules meant a firm could repeatedly break the law as long as it paid the fines issued by Ofgem. ""That's the kind of regulatory gap we want to address,"" he said. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said it already had strong penalties for companies found to be in breach of licence conditions. ""Having a strong set of licence conditions is essential for the protection of consumer rights,"" it said. Labour also revealed figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, which it said showed 16 energy companies faced probes into mis-selling, poor customer service and other bad practices. Ms Flint said the figures showed that the current government had ""presided over a broken energy market"".

"Attorney General Jeremy Wright said it was a ""proper and well established"" principle that governments use the royal prerogative in such cases. But those bringing the case argue that it is vital MPs and peers get a say. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which starts the Brexit process, is to be triggered by the end of next March. Campaigners say the prime minister lacks the power to do this without the prior authorisation of Parliament. But, arguing the government's case, Mr Wright said Article 50 was available to ""to give effect to the will of the people"", as expressed in June's referendum, in which a majority of voters backed Brexit. The use of the royal prerogative - powers historically held by the Crown but these days passed on to ministers - was ""wholly within the expectation of Parliament"", he said. Parliament had also passed an act allowing the referendum to take place, he added. The attorney general said the ""notification - once given - will not be withdrawn. It is our case that Parliament's consent is not required"". James Eadie QC, also representing the government, said the case had ""profound constitutional implications and profound political implications"". He added: ""It also raises a series of questions about how the British constitution should react in unique circumstances that concern the court and confront the country at this time."" Mr Eadie said there was no written, constitutional formula and that the claimants in court wanted to use legal principles developed in different constitutional and legal circumstances to make them fit their argument - ""precisely denying the constitutional flexibility that lies at the heart of our constitution"". Mrs May announced at the Conservative Party conference that she intended giving an Article 50 notification by the end of March 2017 using the royal prerogative. Her opponents argue this would unlawfully remove statutory rights granted to UK citizens under the European Communities Act 1972, which made EU law part of UK law. Because of the urgency and constitutional importance of the case, any appeal is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, before the end of the year.

"Fairer outcomes remained an ""entrenched"" problem, she said, at an event promoting social mobility. Too many pupils fail to reach their potential, said Ms Greening. Making the most of all young people's talent was a ""hard, cold, economic imperative,"" she said. ""Children from high-income backgrounds who show signs of low academic ability at age five, are 35% more likely to become high earners than their poorer peers who show early signs of high ability,"" Ms Greening told a Social Mobility Commission event. Ms Greening said giving a fairer opportunity to all pupils remained a ""really hard long slog"". In her own family, she said she was the first to go to university. And the education secretary said that she had never planned to be a politician - and could remember her father shouting at out-of-touch politicians on the television. He was ""frustrated that he felt they didn't really talk about his life,"" she said. Ms Greening said that poorer pupils, despite any early signs of talent, were more likely to leave school without A-levels and miss out on the chance to go to university. Even among those who went to university, there were still inequalities. ""Graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds who do make it to the top jobs still earn, on average, over Â£2,200 a year less than their colleagues who happen to have been born to professional or managerial parents,"" she said. This was not just economic disadvantage, but also geographic, with some parts of England having much lower attainment, she said. A child living in one of the country's most disadvantaged areas was 27 times more likely to go to an inadequate school than a child in the most advantaged area, said Ms Greening. She said the government's ""opportunity areas"" would help to focus support in such deprived areas. And ensuring a supply of quality teachers could make a big difference to accelerating attainment. With the end of European Union membership, she said, it would become an economic necessity to make better use of all young people's abilities. Rather than employers ""scouring the world"" to find staff, she said, employers would need to focus more on making better use of home-grown talent. The UK had lower levels of productivity than many competitors, much of which was down to low levels of education, and that showed the importance of investing in education and training. But this week the education secretary faced strong criticism from the Public Accounts Committee, who warned the Department for Education had failed to engage with the seriousness of funding problems facing schools. MPs said ministers were failing to recognise the ""real-world consequences"" of their funding plans. The government has said that creating new grammar schools will promote social mobility. But Ms Greening said that any new grammars would also be accompanied by a ""new model"" for selection. ""We're talking about a new model of grammar schools and how selection can work,"" she said. ""It means an education system which caters for the very different talents and potential of different children - whether it's technical education, maths schools or whether it's giving local communities a choice over how selection works at local level. ""If we're really going to have things different - we have to be prepared to look at what that will take. ""Do we want to make sure though that new grammars will work effectively, collaboratively to lift attainment overall? Absolutely - that's precisely why there's so much work going on right now to make sure what we bring forward will be a new model of selection that works constructively to raise attainment.""","Education Secretary Justine Greening has called for a ""hard, cold, economic imperative"" to make better use of all young people's talents.","['The name Justine is not supported by the source text', 'The person was not calling for something but rather making a statement of fact.']",[],0
"Quins overcame the loss of lock George Merrick to injury to score five first-half tries and secure a bonus point, with Stade managing a solitary reply. Tim Visser's intercept try came as Stade rallied early in the second half. Clement Daguin and Willem Alberts tries gave Stade faint hope that Marland Yarde's late try quashed emphatically. It was an impressively dynamic first-half performance in front of watching England boss Eddie Jones, while it was their defensive mettle under more intense pressure in the second period that would have stood out. Quick shifts and sharp set-piece work set up Joe Marler's try from a rolling maul, and after Merrick's injury stoppage, a two-try blast from Joe Marchant and Visser established control. Sekou Macalou returned a skewed Yarde kick for Stade's opener, but two bludgeoning James Chisholm scores extinguished any momentum the Top 14 side had before the break. Gonzalo Quesada's side threatened to breach a creaking Quins defence in the second half before Visser pounced to increase Quins' buffer.

"The moneyed men were from the town's trawling fleets and made their living working ""at the hardest job in the world"". After about three weeks toiling in the fishing grounds, they would return for just three days on land to spend their hard-earned cash before going back to sea. Their lives and other aspects of the booming Grimsby fishing industry of the 1950s are being marked in an exhibition called Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll. Local history enthusiast Alf Ludlam, 71, said: ""The men would stand out in what almost amounted to a uniform. ""They would wear pale grey or blue suits with lots of pleats in the back of the jackets and baggy trousers."" Mr Ludlam, a museum volunteer with Grimsby Council, said the suits were a fashion statement but also a way of saying ""look at my money"" because the trawlermen could afford to buy a extravagant quantity of cloth. And the men wore open-necked shirts as ""however cold it was in town, it was never as cold as on a trawler off Iceland,"" he added . Mr Ludlam remembers watching the men roaming his home town during the 1950s, a time when ""thanks to fishing Grimsby was making more money than ever"". At its peak in that decade, Mr Ludlam said Grimsby was ""the largest fishing port in the world"". The vibrancy of the fishing trade had a spin-off for the rest of the town until the mid-1970s. It was a great period to grow up in Grimsby, Mr Ludlam said, because ""everything was in the melting pot"". ""Fishing was Grimsby's raison d'etre - no fishing, no Grimsby, "" he added. The heyday for the trade lasted about 20 years but the reliance on fishing proved to be a problem for the town as the trawler fleet contracted during, and after, the two decades of the Cod Wars. Iceland started extending its territorial limit around the island to exclude foreign vessels from the water it claimed as its own. The limit was extended on three occasions between 1958 and 1976, each time forcing British fishing vessels further offshore. The limit was finally extended 200 miles off Iceland. This led to confrontations at sea between the Icelandic coastguard and trawlers from Grimsby and Hull. Several ships were even rammed as trawlers continued to try to fish within the new limit. The neighbouring fishing ports of Grimsby and Hull vied with each other in the size and skill of their trawler fleet, and the quality and quantity of fish landed. Mr Ludlam said the ports had ""always been at daggers drawn"" and their fishing fleets were a source of civic pride. He said the collapse of the trawler industry in Grimsby mirrored the similar economic and social struggle former mining towns experienced after the pits closed. The two industries of fishing and mining were also linked by the level of danger encountered. Mr Ludlam said: ""Fishing was the most dangerous - when you set sail you didn't know if you were going to come back."" The free exhibition Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll is open until Sunday January 13 at the Fishing Heritage Centre in Grimsby .","In the 1950s, Grimsby's trawlermen wore suits almost as big as their boats.","[""The summary claims that the trawlermen's suits were almost as big as their boats, but the source text does not make this comparison or suggest such a size for the suits.""]",[],0
"Welsh and UK ministers have been rowing since March over how to finance the commuter lines in and out of Cardiff. Mr Crabb said the scheme - estimated at Â£309m to Â£463m - was ""probably the most knotty"" problem between the two governments but was soluble. The valleys rail electrification is due to be completed between 2019 and 2024. Planned rail improvements will see the upgrade of the main line from London Paddington to Cardiff, which is due to be completed by 2017, and extended to Swansea by 2018 at a cost of Â£850m. The electrification of the Valleys lines was due to follow, but the plan was thrown into doubt in March by a row over the financing of the project. Speaking on Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme, Mr Crabb said rail electrification was the ""number one issue"" for him. He said: ""It's something that I've been spending quite a bit of my summer working on. ""There's a bit more work to be done between the two governments on where we think the solution lies, but I think when I go around talking to businesses in south Wales they are desperate to see this problem answered, they want the two governments to be working effectively together.""

John Berry originally formed the Beastie Boys as a hardcore punk band with three friends in 1981 and came up with the name for the group. He played guitar on their first EP, Polly Wog Stew, but left before they achieved commercial success. Berry attended the Walden School in New York with fellow band member Mike Diamond, known as Mike D. The pair were later joined by Adam Yauch and Kate Schellenbach and released their debut EP in 1982. When Berry left the group, he was replaced by Adam Horovitz, known as Ad-Rock, and the band took a new direction as a rap group. Schellenback also left the group before the release of their 1986 album Licence To Ill, which debuted at number one in the US. The group became a huge commercial success, recording a total of eight studio albums over 25 years, which collectively sold more than 50 million copies worldwide. Four of them reached number one in the US, while their 1998 album Hello Nasty topped the album chart in the UK. Their best-known hits include (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!), Intergalactic, and Ch-Check It Out. Seven of their albums achieved platinum sales status and the band toured with Madonna in 1985. Beastie Boys remained a three-piece until Adam Yauch's death from cancer in 2012.

Frontal lobe dementia is a form of dementia that occurs when the frontal lobes of the brain begin to shrink. It is an uncommon form of dementia and is thought to affect about 16,000 people in the UK. Frontal lobe dementia is distinct from Alzheimer's disease and comes on earlier in life, usually between the ages of 45 and 65. Symptoms include problems with behaviour, language and thinking.

"Rosie Batty, 52, from Tyabb, a small town in Victoria, began her work after her son Luke, 11, was stabbed to death. She received the award from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott at a ceremony at Parliament House, Canberra. The award winners are selected from public nominations and announced ahead of Australia Day, on 26 January. The 2015 Young Australian of the Year is 21-year-old West Australian Drisana Levitzke-Gray, a young deaf woman who advocates for other deaf people. Senior Australian of the Year is 61-year-old Jackie French from New South Wales, a children's author and advocate for children with learning difficulties, and the Australian Local Hero is 41-year-old Juliette Wright from Queensland, who established an online platform to get goods and services to vulnerable and marginalised people. This year was the first time in the 55-year history of the awards that women have secured the top honour in all four categories. The recipients were great Australians and great role models, said chairman of the National Australia Day Council, Ben Roberts-Smith. ""It is a great moment in the 55-year history of these awards to honour four women. ""Rosie, Jackie, Drisana and Juliette remind us of the many ways in which women contribute to our nation; that women are a force for change, a voice for rights, influencers, educators and the heart of our communities,"" he said. After her son's death, UK-born Ms Batty emerged as an articulate and powerful advocate for the rights of women and children living in violent relationships, giving new force to efforts to prevent family violence across Australia. Family violence activists say Ms Batty's ability to explain to the public why so many women struggle to protect their children from violent partners helped make the issue of family violence a key campaign issue for all political parties in last November's Victoria state election. Greg Anderson, 54, killed Luke Batty in front of shocked onlookers at a cricket oval in Tyabb. The father and son had been playing together during an access visit in February 2014 when Anderson suddenly struck his son with a cricket bat and stabbed him. Anderson was shot by police after threatening them with a knife when they tried to detain him. He died later in hospital. Ms Batty was at the cricket ground when the attack happened. The public killing shocked Australians in a way that many other acts of family violence committed every week in the country have not.",A woman who campaigned against family violence in Australia has been named the 2015 Australian of the Year.,"['The summary mistakes her reward.The summary claims she was awarded the 2015 Australian of the Year, but in the source text she was awarded an unamed reward, and someone else was awarded the 2015 Australian of the Year.']",[],0
"Willie Macleod, executive director of the British Hospitality Association, said many retailers ""relied on daily deliveries"" from Blochairn. Firefighters began tackling the blaze in the early hours of Thursday. Mr Macleod said suppliers at the market were sure to be ""resilient"" but that businesses would be impacted. City Property, which owns the site, said it was trying to establish alternative arrangements so that normal business could resume as soon as possible. Mr Macleod told the BBC: ""The impact on the market - short and medium-term - is not yet clear, it's unlikely that normal operations will be possible for the immediate or foreseeable future. ""Any disruption to supplies of fresh produce will have an impact on hospitality businesses and caterers, as well as retailers - many of whom rely on daily deliveries."" Mr Macleod said that in the immediate term, menus were likely to be adjusted and, in some cases, fresh produce would be substituted by frozen items. He added: ""I'm sure that the wholesale suppliers which operate out of Blochairn will be resilient and adaptable and will already be looking at alternative arrangements for their customers - possibly using alternative markets such as Edinburgh or Newcastle in the interim. ""Hospitality businesses will look for alternative, short-term sources of supply where they can. ""Many larger chains and branded outlets operating in the west of Scotland will have national or regional procurement arrangements in place - these will not necessarily be reliant on Blochairn, so the impact in these cases is unlikely to be so severe."" Donald Neilson, director of seafood company John Vallance, had been processing orders and loading vans when the fire broke out. ""It was a pretty quick evacuation and most of our stock was left lying,"" he said. ""We supply from the market to other wholesalers, restaurants, hotels, fish and chip shops and places like that. ""The west of Scotland and central Scotland - all the restaurants and hotels - will have to go without orders today."" Mr Neilson said he was hopeful the fire had been stopped before it got the the fish market area. ""Hopefully we'll get back into the markets as soon as possible because all our computers and office stuff is there. ""We also want to check our chills, our freezers and our tanks are ok."" In the meantime, he said they had secured temporary warehouse space and hoped to provide a service from there. Jim McGhee, who owns Castle Douglas fruit and veg shop Mitchell's, was also there when the fire broke out. ""We have a wholesale fruit business with a retail outlet and we go to the market two to three times a week,"" he said. ""I had just got my lorry loaded up luckily - there were a couple of things I didn't get because the police asked us all to leave the area. ""There is a bit of the market that hasn't been touched by the fire so I would think we will still be OK next week to get stuff. ""The top end of the market has escaped the fire it is just the bottom end."" He said a couple of the fruit and vegetable businesses been affected, and the flower market had been burned. ""I managed to get a load this morning, I was up there quite early and I was just about fully loaded when the fire broke out, so I am OK for today and the weekend,"" he added.

"In a video released hours ahead of his official launch in Miami, the 62-year-old brother of ex-president George W Bush declared: ""I'm ready to lead."" He also promised to protect the country's most vulnerable and remove the barriers to social mobility. But doubts persist among conservatives in his party. And early polling suggests that he has yet to dominate a wide field of Republican candidates. In his latest video, entitled The Greatest Century, he strikes a very optimistic note, saying: ""I see a great country on the verge of its greatest century, and I'm ready to lead."" The Bush team may have hoped their man would have built a clear lead in the polls by now, but the consensus view is he's currently just one in a pack of frontrunners. Recent interviews with campaign strategists indicate that they are going to start using the millions of dollars at their disposal to target opponents they consider most threatening - namely, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. In his opening campaign video, Mr Bush emphasised his positive, optimistic vision for the future, saying some politicians ""talk about problems; I see solutions"". But in the coming months, the fight for the Republican presidential nomination could get nasty. Although his campaign becomes official on Monday, it's been no secret for many months and his team is well on the way to raising a $100m war chest. During a tour of Europe last week, Mr Bush warned he would not waver from his core beliefs, even if some are unpopular in his party. ""I'm not going to change who I am,"" he said. ""I respect people who may not agree with me, but I'm not going to change my views because today someone has a view that's different."" In a separate video, called Making A Difference, he champions the rights of women, ethnic minorities and the disabled. ""My core beliefs start with the premise that the most vulnerable in our society should be in the front of the line and not the back,'' he says. ""What we need is new leadership that takes conservative principles and applies them so that people can rise up."" Profile: Jeb Bush . A Spanish language video was also released, demonstrating his strong Hispanic links - his wife Columba is Mexican and he speaks Spanish well. But in recent weeks he has found himself on the defensive over the Iraq War - led by his older brother, President George W Bush - as he stumbled to clarify his position. The issue brought into focus the problems he may face over his famous surname and the baggage that comes with it. He becomes the 11th Republican to declare, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Florida Senator Marco Rubio among his biggest rivals. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is the clear frontrunner. This raises the possibility in 2016 of another Clinton-Bush race like that of 1992, when Mrs Clinton's husband Bill beat Jeb Bush's father, President George HW Bush.

"Italy, stuck in recession, hopes the fair will be a big money-spinner. Ten million tickets have been sold already for the six-month event. But shortly after the opening, protesters in Milan clashed with police, who responded with tear gas. Representatives of 145 countries are in the city for the fair, which boasts 54 national pavilions at a sprawling site. The food theme focuses on nutrition and combating hunger globally. But it is also a showcase for Italian cuisine. The exhibition has already been marred by scandal after several officials in the organising body were arrested for corruption. And violence broke out on Friday as dozens of people protesting against the Expo torched cars and broke shops windows. Some groups have criticised the fair, calling it a symbol of big business interests, and held protests. There was an anti-globalisation march by students in Milan on Thursday. Pope Francis, who spoke via a televised link-up to the opening ceremony, said he wanted every person who visited the Expo to think of the ""faces of millions of people who are hungry today"". Meanwhile Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said: ""Today it is as though Italy is embracing the world.""

"In the ruined village of Arquata del Tronto, a group of bloggers has gone in search of its destroyed history, posting findings on a Facebook page called Chiedi alla polvere (Ask The Dust). ""Ask the dust"" is an old saying that usually refers to something unknowable. But here, some young residents want to give the dust a voice. Time in the hilltop village of Arquata del Tronto did not just stop during the quake, which struck in the night at 03:36 (01:36 GMT), it disintegrated: the shock wrenched the minute hand from the village clock. Visits to the no-go ""red zones"" are brief and hazardous, and firefighters bark you back on to the road if you start down an alley or peer too closely into a ruined house. But the dust stays with you. A fine white coating that clings to your boots. From a tent in an aid camp in Arquata's lower village, the bloggers post old photos of the village and its surroundings, stories and reflections, news about the relief effort, blogging in Italian and English. One entry shows a child's drawing of an idyllic little house with a horse and a hen - next to a photo of a ruin. ""I thought I was at my house,"" it begins. ""There where nothing bad that could happen. My refuge, my every day, my bed, my beloved couch where I spent entire afternoons in winter watching movies."" ""Unfortunately,"" the post ends, it became ""that part of TV that every time I hate to see"" - the TV news. ""My couch is gone."" When Gaia Paolini, 18, comes home from her school in Ascoli Piceno she spends time with her childhood friends curating the blog. She is one of the lucky ones whose home survived the quake. ""We put our emotions, all our story, the story of the village, into the page,"" she says. ""We are trying to preserve the memory of this place and also trying to preserve its future after the construction of new buildings that we hope can be made soon."" The blog records the support that the village has received, from the aid effort co-ordinated by the government to the concerts played by visiting musicians in the canteen tent, which is also used for church services. ""We have so much help from local people and people all over Italy and it is so beautiful,"" Gaia says. Another website translates a poem from before the quake about Pescara del Tronto, a hamlet near Arquata that suffered even greater damage: 48 people died there, including 12 tourists. ""Pescara sweet notes . Of water, . Pescara of rocks and labours . Stories of fathers . Ancient Tales, . Pescara of houses . Cling to each other . Like sisters or friends. Pescara perfume . From childhood and memories . Walls of stone . Warm sunsets."" The poem, written by someone called Eidi, comes from Pescara's website, which has become a virtual time capsule for the pre-quake days when holidaymakers headed there for the mountain air and tranquillity. One day the tourists will return to the Tronto Valley and its ruined villages will be rebuilt. This latest chapter of its history will then stand as a record of the years turned into dust and of the young bloggers' love for a place they called home.","In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that struck central Italy last month, residents are using social media to chronicle their lives.","['the summary adds info not found in the source text about when the quake happened.', 'the summary adds info not found in the source text about where the quake happened.']","[' The summary states that residents are using social media to chronicle their lives, but the text specifies that the bloggers are chronicling the history and memory of the village, not their personal lives.']",0

"Oswald 'Ossie' Bradley was swimming to an island in Bessbrook Pond to remove two Irish tricolour flags from trees.

A teenage boy managed to bring Mr Bradley ashore at about 17:00 BST on Monday where attempts were made to resuscitate him. Emergency services took him to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry, about four miles away, where it was announced that he had died. Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said the death was devastating news for the man's family and the village of Bessbrook.

""I think the action that he undertook yesterday was probably uncharacteristic of him, from what I hear from friends of his,"" said the assembly member. ""Bessbrook is a mixed community, Catholics and Protestants live side-by-side and, generally speaking down through the years, community relations have been very good. ""I believe some local councillors and the police have arranged for the flags to be removed.""

He was involved in the campaign seeking justice for the victims of an IRA gun attack near his village, that became known as the Kingsmill massacre. FAIR's chaplain Pastor Barrie Halliday, who knew Mr Bradley personally for more than 30 years, said he ""loved"" the union flag and displayed it at his house. ""Some people say it was totally out of character but maybe we need to take it in context of his great interest in working along with the Kingsmill families - a tragedy of nearly 40 years ago that's going on today.

""Following improvements at a previous inspection in April last year, the practice has been unable to sustain these and they now return to special measures.

"The 111 service, replacing NHS Direct, is due to launch in England on Monday. The British Medical Association's letter to Sir David Nicholson follows reported problems in trial areas. Health Minister Lord Howe has said some areas will have more time to go live with 111 while ""thorough testing"" to ensure reliability is carried out. Lord Howe has already admitted the new 111 telephone advice service - which the government has said will ease pressure on emergency 999 phone lines - had run into ""teething problems"". But the BMA said that in several areas it seemed to have been completely unable to cope with call volumes or suffered severe IT failures. It said patient safety was being put at risk. Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the the BMA's GP committee, said: ""There have been widespread reports of patients being unable to get through to an operator or waiting hours before getting a call back with the health information they have requested, . ""In some areas, such as Greater Manchester, NHS 111 effectively crashed because it was unable to cope with the number of calls it was receiving. The quality of advice being given out has also been questionable in some instances."" He said the ""chaotic mess"" of 111 was ""placing strain"" on overstretched parts of the NHS, such as the ambulance service, and potentially placing patients at risk. ""The BMA has been warning the government about the problems with NHS 111 for almost two years. They must finally act to ensure that patient safety is guaranteed,"" he added. The BMA said it had written to NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to call for a delay to the launch of 111 until it was ""fully safe for the public"". Dr Buckman said: ""We cannot sacrifice patient safety in order to meet a political deadline for the launch of a service that doesn't work properly."" The Department of Health has already sanctioned an extension of up to six months of the original 1 April 2013 deadline for regions struggling to set up the new service. The NHS Direct 0845 4647 service will continue to be available to callers in areas where the NHS 111 service is not yet available, Lord Howe has said.

"Wales led after an hour of the first Test before losing 39-21, and succumbed 36-22 in the second after being level 10-10 at the break. That extended New Zealand's winning run against Wales to 28 games since 1953. ""We just switch off for five-10 minutes and before you know it, New Zealand have pulled away,"" said Williams. ""But there are encouraging signs that we are playing a more expansive game."" Wales' efforts have had the former Cardiff Blues and Pontypridd player ""on the edge of his seat"". But the former Wales captain and British and Irish Lions tourist has been disappointed that his country have not been able to beat an All Blacks team in transition following high-profile retirements. After the 2015 World Cup, the All Blacks lost record-breaking flanker and captain Richie McCaw, fly-half Dan Carter and midfield pair Ma'a Nonu and Conrad Smith. ""There are two schools of thought at the moment in Wales,"" said Williams. ""One, 'yes we've gone toe-to-toe with the All Blacks and played some great rugby'. ""And the other one is, 'well we've failed again' because they are a team in transition. I don't care how good the players are … I'm a little bit disappointed. ""Whenever you take 700 caps of experience out of a squad, it's got to leave a dent and traditionally they are slow in June. ""On the flip side, you look at our squad - it was the most experienced that's ever left these shores. We didn't have injury worries so I thought this was our opportunity."" The All Blacks have made five starting changes for the third Test, with coach Steve Hansen hoping the risk will have its rewards. Flanker Elliott Dixon makes his debut at blind-side flanker in place of Jerome Kaino, while George Moala takes over at centre from injured Malakai Fekitoa. Fly-half Beauden Barrett makes only his eighth All Blacks start in 38 appearances as he takes over from Aaron Cruden, who was injured in the second Test. Barrett has scored 26 points, including three tries in four appearances against Wales. Two of those tries came in a 15-point haul as New Zealand beat Wales 34-16 in Cardiff in 2014 in his previous start against Warren Gatland's side. Barrett crossed for his third try against Wales in Wellington last weekend. Charlie Faumuina takes over from Owen Franks at prop and Julian Savea returns on the wing in place of Waisake Naholo, who drops to the bench. Injury has forced out veteran Wales prop Gethin Jenkins as well as lock Bradley Davies. Rob Evans is back at loose-head prop, while Gatland brings in Tomas Francis at tight-head as Samson Lee is relegated to replacement duty. Gatland, a leading candidate to return to New Zealand as British and Irish Lions coach in 2017, wants his team to stop 'shooting themselves in the foot'. If so, Williams, who was coached by Gatland and Hansen in a 100-cap Wales career says the Dunedin encounter ""could well be"" the one in which his countrymen end 63 years of hurt.

"A government directive said they would be transferred to Thengar Char before being repatriated to Myanmar.

The low-lying land is around 30km (18 miles) east of Hatiya island, which has a population of 600,000 - and nine hours' journey from the camps where the Rohingya have taken shelter. An official in the region told the AFP news agency Thengar Char was ""only accessible during winter and is a haven for pirates"". The official said trees had been planted in a bid to protect the land from flooding, but these efforts were at least a decade off completion. ""It completely inundates during the monsoon,"" the official told AFP. ""It's a terrible idea to send someone to live there."" In Myanmar, the Rohingya are denied citizenship and treated as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.

Some 232,000 - both registered and unregistered - were already living in Bangladesh before that influx, many in refugee camps with poor facilities.

"He was leading after the first run but was beaten by home favourite Marcel Hirscher to record the first podium of his career. It was the best result for just over 35 years, since Konrad Bartelski came second in a downhill in Italy in 1981. The 30-year-old had finished sixth and seventh already this season. He told BBC Sport: ""The first run was just insane. I knew I had skied it clean, but couldn't believe it when I crossed the finish line. ""In between runs I tried not to get the heart rate up or get stressed. I was trying to tell myself I wasn't the last one to go but it was tough.

Ryding, who learnt to ski on a dry slope at Pendle Ski Club, has been a member of the British ski team since 2006 and competed in the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics, finishing 17th. He had a 0.29 seconds lead over Italy's Stefano Gross going into the second run with Hirscher 1.02 seconds behind. But the Austrian, who won the race in 2013 and has won the overall slalom title three times, had a storming second run to move from seventh to first, with Ryding ending up 0.76 seconds adrift. More than 60,000 spectators were watching and Ryding said the noise was deafening. ""Kitzbuhel is like the FA Cup final in England. The downhill race is the number one but the slalom is also massive. The fans are incredible."" The alpine ski World Cup was formed in 1967 and, in 50 years of racing, Ryding and Bartelski are the only British men to finish on the podium while Gina Hathorn (1967) and Divina Galica (1968) scored top three finishes on the women's circuit. When Bartelski did it in Val Gardena, Italy, it led a French commentator to say: ""This is not possible, he is English!""

"Sarah Pond said a member of staff at the Staffordshire theme park said: ""You need to get off, you have one hand."" ""Never in my life have I been spoken to like this,"" said Miss Pond. ""I was not offered a reason why when I explained I have been on this ride about 10 times."" Alton Towers said it had apologised to Miss Pond, who was not allowed to ride the rollercoaster for safety reasons. More on this story and updates from Stoke & Staffordshire . ""We are in contact with her directly and will endeavour to reach a resolution,"" the theme park said in a statement. Miss Pond was barred from the Smiler rollercoaster, the ride on which several people were seriously injured last year. In a Facebook post, Miss Pond, 33, from Shrewsbury, said she had been ""astonished"" to see a girl with her arm in a plaster cast allowed on to the ride. She wrote: ""I read the rules of the ride. You need to be able to walk 25m without help. And climb a ladder. Well I can assure you I can, nothing is wrong with my legs!"" She added: ""I'm still angry and upset. Never in my 33 years of life have I been treated with such discrimination over being born without my hand. ""I am not registered disabled as I'm too able bodied and for that reason can't claim any benefits."" A spokeswoman for the theme park said: ""On arrival at the ride entrance, our staff did advise that for safety reasons, she would not be eligible to ride the Smiler. ""We aim to ensure that disabled guests are treated with respect and in a manner that is appropriate to their needs, whilst maintaining equality for all of our visitors."" Miss Pond said the experience had put her off ever going to Alton Towers again and disputed the claim she was told at the ride's entrance she could not go on the rollercoaster. Alton Towers' owners, Merlin Attractions, face a large fine as a result of the Smiler crash last June.

"Seleka rebels were said to be fighting running battles with government troops. The fighters, who have been involved in an on-off rebellion since December, accuse President Francois Bozize of failing to honour a peace deal. Former colonial power France has called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, and reportedly sent troops to secure the airport. French officials warned French nationals in the country should stay at home. Rebel spokesman Nelson Ndjadder said they had shot down a government military helicopter and were now heading for the presidential palace. However, there were no further reports of fighting as darkness fell. The rebels are also said to have cut off electrical power to parts of the city, having taken control of three power plants in the neighbouring town of Boali. A local UN official in southern Bangui said people were in a state of panic but could not confirm the rebels had entered the city. The rebels joined a power-sharing government in January after talks brokered by regional leaders to end a rebellion they launched last year. But the deal quickly collapsed, with the rebels saying their demands, including the release of political prisoners, had not been met. On Friday it was reported that they had taken a checkpoint in the town of Damara, about an hour's drive from Bangui, where regional Fomac peacekeepers are based. BBC Africa editor Richard Hamilton says government soldiers have been unable to fend off the rebels because Mr Bozize fears being overthrown in a coup and is therefore wary of having a strong army. He came to power himself in a military coup in 2003. CAR has been hit by a series of rebellions since independence from France in 1960.

Howden, who was re-elected in December, has denied that the move is related to the publication of the report. A former managing director of Jaguar Cars, Browning was appointed to the British Cycling board as a non-executive director in March 2015.

"Mohammed Allan, an alleged activist for the Islamic Jihad militant group, was on a respirator and was being given fluids, an Israeli hospital said. His case is being seen as a test of a recent Israeli law authorising the force-feeding of hunger strikers. Israeli doctors are challenging the law, which they say is unethical. The Israeli Medical Association has described force-feeding as tantamount to torture and a violation of a patient's rights. It has urged doctors to refuse orders to perform the procedure. Supporters of the law say force-feeding is necessary to save prisoners from death, and to discourage them from using hunger strikes as a tactic to end - or draw attention - to their detention. It is not yet known if Mr Allan will be subjected to the controversial procedure, in which doctors forcibly insert a tube into the empty stomach. The decision could depend on his medical condition. A statement from the Barzilai hospital, where Mr Allan is being treated, said his condition had deteriorated on Friday morning but remained stable. ""The treatment is being administered according the ethics committee guidelines and includes respiration and intravenous fluids and saline,"" a hospital statement said. Jamil al-Khatib, a lawyer for Mr Allan, told the AFP news agency that he had heard his client had gone into a coma and that Israeli authorities were planning to force-feed him. However, an Arab-Israeli MP, Osama Saadi, told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Allan was not being force-fed and was not in coma.

"The Daily Telegraph reported that the star would be dropped after an internal investigation concluded he had attacked a producer on the show. It said director general Tony Hall would explain that such behaviour could not be tolerated at the BBC. Clarkson tweeted a rebuttal of the story on Wednesday morning. ""Just to keep everyone up to date, I haven't heard a thing,"" he wrote, shortly before 10:00 GMT. The BBC also says no final decision had been made on Clarkson's future. ""When we have an outcome, we will announce it,"" said a BBC spokesman. Clarkson was suspended 16 days ago following an alleged ""fracas"" with producer Oisin Tymon. The row was said to have occurred because no hot food was laid on for the presenter following a day's filming in North Yorkshire. An internal investigation began last week, led by Ken MacQuarrie, the director of BBC Scotland. Mr Tymon did not file a formal complaint and it is understood Clarkson reported himself to BBC bosses. The BBC's director of television, Danny Cohen, felt he had no choice but to suspend the presenter pending an investigation. The decision caused an outpouring of support from Top Gear fans, with more than a million people signing an online petition to reinstate him. Whatever the outcome of the BBC's inquiry, the motoring show is expected to continue. It is one of BBC Two's most popular programmes, and overseas sales generate an estimated £50m a year for the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. Whether Clarkson's co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond would continue in his absence has yet to be confirmed. All three have their contracts up for renewal this year.

"That is a key department policy which decides whether schools should close or not. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said that the policy is undermined by ""flawed and inaccurate data"". Education Minister John O'Dowd said he would consider what additional action, if any, needed to be taken. He said: ""The sustainable schools policy has been tested in court on several occasions and found to be a competent policy upon which to make decisions both about the future of individual schools and area planning more widely. ""I have already accepted the eight recommendations within the Northern Ireland Audit Office report and these are being progressed by my department."" The policy is also used to plan educational provision across Northern Ireland. The PAC also said that the number of empty places in schools in Northern Ireland is ""likely to be overstated"". A Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) report previously found the number of empty places totalled over 71,000, about 20% of capacity. However, the NIAO also said that the department did not have a standard method for calculating school capacity. The PAC said it was ""unacceptable"" that the department could not provide accurate numbers of surplus places. The committee is calling for up-to-date school enrolment figures to be gathered ""as a matter of urgency"". The PAC report also said the department took too long to take decisions on whether to close schools, and whether suspended teachers should be dismissed. It found that 106 teachers had been suspended during the past five years, but only six had been dismissed. The department paid Â£4.2m on wages, national insurance and pension contributions for suspended teachers during that period.

"The Six Nations' annual start could move from February to April with bonus points and promotion and relegation being introduced. Davies says the current demands on players are ""unsustainable"", prompting talks over a ""global season"". He says the WRU held ""discussions"" with New Zealand in June over the issue. Recently installed World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said moving the Six Nations to April ""could be a solution"" in a global calendar. The idea was on the agenda in 2003 amid concerns over fixture overlaps and clashes between clubs and countries. In 2014 the Rugby Players' Association, representing players in England, urged changes to the playing calendar for the sake of player welfare. Davies witnessed Wales' 18-Test season ending in a 3-0 whitewash against the All Blacks in June, a year after preparations for the 2015 World Cup started. ""The main reason for the global season is player welfare, to try to cut down the numbers of games players are playing,"" Davies told BBC Radio Wales. ""Our guys were in New Zealand in June, July. They started training the first week of June the previous year. ""The New Zealand guys couldn't get over it. These guys had been going for 13 months playing international rugby - that is not sustainable. ""And it was a World Cup year and exceptional year etc, finishing with the New Zealand tour."" For southern hemisphere teams, hosting rivals from the northern hemisphere also disrupts their Super Rugby domestic tournament calendar. Davies added: ""Basically they want us to move a month or so so they can have a clear run-in. ""I think we see it, just moving three or four weeks is not going to help the northern hemisphere with player welfare, for example. ""So it is a bigger question than just the Six Nations. That is being looked at at the moment. ""There's a Six Nations council meeting at the end of this month and this isn't to fuel speculation, it is an annual review of where the Six Nations sits. ""So is it worth considering moving it? Do we look at bonus points, which is something that people have asked for to make it more exciting, scoring tries etc? ""Do we look at 'is it a closed shop for Six Nations?' Do we open the gates to Georgia, Romania or anybody else who is deemed worthy and is capable of being in there? ""So all those are up for grabs really. ""Moving the Six Nations - I don't see it as a problem if it helps other things. ""I don't think we need to move it for the sake of it because it does work where it is now - it gets huge following, huge TV audiences etc. ""But if it were necessary to move it in order that it were a piece of the jigsaw that enabled northern and southern hemispheres to have a coherent global season, then it's worth doing.""

""As a result of these actions, and to avoid his capture, in recent days, the fugitive engaged in a hasty retreat, which, according to the information received, caused him injuries to one leg and the face,"" the statement said. ""It's important to clarify that these injuries were not a product of a direct clash,"" it added, without giving further details. The statement added: ""The security cabinet continues to conduct all actions that will allow the recapture of this criminal."" Mexico has arrested several prison officials since Guzman's escape. Investigators said he had inside help to flee through a tunnel that ran 1.5km from under a shower in his cell to outside the prison. After his escape, Guzman took to Twitter to taunt the police and insult President Pena Nieto. Guzman was first arrested in Guatemala in 1993 and spent nearly a decade in another maximum-security Mexican jail before escaping, reportedly in a laundry basket. He was on the run for 13 years before being held again in 2014 after a series of high-profile arrests of associates and covert surveillance by the US authorities.","Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman has been injured during an operation to recapture him, the government says.","['Summary gives first name for Guzman which is not supported by the source text.

"Mr Abdel Fattah had been sentenced to 15 years in jail for violating a strict anti-protest law. He is currently facing a retrial in the case. Mr Abdel Fattah gained fame during the 2011 uprising against the then-President, Hosni Mubarak. His arrest had heightened fears of a crackdown on dissent in Egypt. Correspondents say the 15-year sentence was one of the harshest ever awarded to a non-Islamist activist in the country. Mr Abdel Fattah had been charged with assaulting a policeman at an illegal protest. He was sentenced in June, along with 24 others, but was not allowed to be in court for the verdict. The same judges presided over his retrial, prompting Mr Abdel Fattah to complain that he had ""no confidence"" in them. A lawyer for Mr Abdel Fattah, Mohammed Abdel-Aziz, said on Monday that the judge presiding over the retrial had stepped down at the request of the defence team. He said the judge had also ordered an investigation into the prosecutor's use of Mr Abdul Fattah's personal videos, ""which violated the accused's privacy"". At a previous hearing, the prosecutor had shown videos of family celebrations which had no link to the case, Mr Abdel-Aziz told AFP news agency. The retrial will resume when a new judge is assigned to the case. Mr Abdel Fattah is expected to leave prison on Tuesday. Along with two other activists, whose release was also ordered by the court, he must pay 5,000 Egyptian pounds ($430; $700) as bail. Mr Abdel Fattah comes from a prominent family of Egyptian activists. His sister, Sanaa Seif, is also in custody on charges of violating the protest law. His father, Ahmed Seif al-Islam, was a leading human rights lawyer and campaigner who died late last month. Hundreds of people have been killed in street clashes since the military ousted President Mohammed Morsi last year. Thousands have also been arrested, most of them Islamists who supported Mr Morsi. The crackdown has since been extended to student leaders and secular activists who had protested against Mr Mubarak. Former army chief Abdul Fattah al-Sisi took office as president after winning 96.9% of the vote in elections in May - almost a year after he ousted Mr Morsi. However turnout was below 50%, as Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and some liberal and secular activists urged a boycott of the poll. Also on Monday, an Egyptian court sentenced the Muslim Brotherhood's leader, Mohammed Badie, and 14 others to life in jail on charges of murder and inciting violence at protests near Cairo last year. Mr Morsi's predecessor, Hosni Mubarak, stepped down after mass anti-government protests in 2011, following nearly three decades in power.","A court in Egypt has ordered the release on bail of one of the country's most prominent activists, Alaa Abdel Fattah.","['The name Alaa does not appear in the text', 'The designation of the person as ""one of the country\'s most prominent activists"" is not proven, though he is an activist.']",[],0
"Peter Lloyd, 45, lives in a tent in the garden of an ""uninhabitable"" house, Cardiff Civil Justice Centre heard. Mr Lloyd, who has electromagnetic hypersensitivity, said he was entitled to direct payments to employ a helper. The council, which was ordered to pay Â£12,000 in costs, had claimed he was not capable of managing money. Quashing the council's decision on Wednesday, Mr Justice Singh said electromagnetic hypersensitivity was not a recognised condition in the UK. He added it was ""not a matter for the court to say what the decision would have been if the authority went about its decision correctly"". Direct payments are given to individuals by councils so they can buy help or services instead of having them supplied by the authority. Mr Lloyd lives in the back garden of a privately-owned home in Thornhill and has refused alternative accommodation and a portable toilet, the court heard. He urinates in plastic bottles and defecates in bed pans lined with black bin bags. He has no running water and an insurance company deemed the house uninhabitable after flooding and the discovery of asbestos - although that has since been removed. When council workers went to collect Mr Lloyd's waste in May, they found 90 litres of urine and 40 bags of faeces. He has meals delivered five times a week, including supplies for the weekend on a Friday. As he has no fridge, he has to have food which will not go off. Representing Mr Lloyd, Christian Howells said: ""Where he lives has to be adapted because the symptoms are very real to him."" He described the situation as ""chicken and egg"" - Mr Lloyd wants the money to pay for help to improve his day-to-day life but the council felt he was not in a position to be given the funds. Rebecca Stickler, for the council, said: ""The housing department has offered housing in a field and various properties and he has refused them all. ""It can't possibly be the case that a local authority should be compelled to use the public purse to pay money to someone who they know cannot manage that payment."" Mr Lloyd's private landlord has begun eviction proceedings in county court, he is estranged from his family and the council recognises him as homeless. Speaking after the hearing, councillor Susan Elsmore, cabinet member for social care, health and wellbeing, insisted the council had never said Mr Lloyd was not capable of managing money. ""The council's role as a social services authority is to ensure that individuals have the opportunity to benefit from an appropriate assessment of their needs, and any services that may be necessary to meet them,"" she said. ""The council maintains that it has acted in keeping with its responsibilities, and in relation to this case that it has acted in good faith.""",A homeless man with ahypersensitivity to electromagnetic radiation has won a High Court battle with Cardiff council over social care payments.,"['The summary says the homeless man won the court battle for payments, but the source says the opposite.']",[],1
"The 44-year-old former Celtic boss will be assisted by Garry Parker at Easter Road. The Northern Irishman has been out of work since parting company with Bolton in March. He succeeds Alan Stubbs, who left for Rotherham United last week after two seasons in charge, culminating in a Scottish Cup final triumph. ""As soon as Neil was identified as the outstanding candidate we were determined to bring him to Easter Road,"" said Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster. ""He has managed at a very high level, taking Celtic to the last 16 of the Champions League, and we were attracted by his ability to get the most out of players and his driven, winning mentality."" Lennon served Celtic as a midfielder for six-and-a-half years, winning five Scottish titles and six domestic cups to add to the two League Cups he won with Leicester. After a spell back in English football with Nottingham Forest and Wycombe Wanderers, Lennon rejoined Celtic as a coach in 2008, taking over as manager in 2010. He enjoyed further success at Celtic Park with three successive top-flight titles and two Scottish Cup triumphs before leaving in the summer of 2014. A move to Bolton followed later that year and, although Wanderers initially improved under Lennon, they were bottom of the Championship by the time he left, with the side eventually relegated.

"Det Con Anthony Rees-Thompson, 40, was caught by a speed camera doing 35mph in a 30mph zone in Swansea. But the South Wales Police officer from Abercrave, Powys, denied it was him and changed his number plates, Cardiff Crown Court heard. He denied perverting the course of justice but a jury found him guilty. Judge David Wynn Morgan told Rees-Thompson the offence ""strikes at the heart of the criminal justice system"". He said the points system was to punish people who drive badly, and it depended on the honest completion of the relevant forms. He added: ""Yours wasn't a panic reaction - it was a carefully considered and thought out course of action."" The court heard Rees-Thompson had been driving along Fabian Way on his way to buy tickets for an Ospreys rugby match when he was caught speeding in a car belonging to his stepfather, who was away on holiday. The defendant, who has worked for South Wales Police for 10 years, challenged the fixed penalty notice and was asked to submit photographic proof that it was not the same vehicle. But the court heard he sent in photographs of the silver Vauxhall Corsa with new plates customised with a blue GB sign and the Welsh flag, bought for Â£21 online. The father-of-four then wrote to the speed camera unit saying there had been a technical error or another similar car was using the same registration number. The jury heard the police officer, a father of four, worked in the covert operations management unit at South Wales Police headquarters in Bridgend. But the prosecution argued he forgot that his car was being filmed every day as he drove it into work. The jury was shown pictures of the car with its old number plate before the speeding offence and the new one allegedly fitted by Rees-Thompson. The court was also told that Rees-Thompson pretended to be his stepfather when he wrote to the speed camera unit trying to avoid a fine and three points on his licence. He denied perverting the course of justice during his trial claiming he changed the plates because they were damaged.

"The deal will create the second largest cable broadband provider in the US. Charter had to agree to not stop its content providers from separately selling shows online, as part of the approval.

"A spokesman for the US authorities said the operation had targeted high-level members of the cartel. The spokesman said the operation had dealt a strong blow to the criminal organisation. It comes weeks after the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, Joaquin Guzman was arrested after six months on the run. Inside the feared Sinaloa cartel . 'El Chapo' Guzman and the Sinaloa cartel . The spokesman, for the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency said they had helped Mexican police target a Sinaloa cartel cell operating around the Mexican city of Sonoyta, along the border with the US state of Arizona. He said it was responsible for importing millions of dollars of illegal drugs, including cannabis, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine into the US from Mexico during its existence. The operation was conducted in total secrecy with police working in both Lukeville and Sonoyta, bordering cities that are on the route to the Puerto Penasco, the popular beach destination many Americans know as Rocky Point. Mexican police officers had been allowed into the US to keep them safe during the operations the US immigration authorities had said. The arrests are the latest blow to the Sinaloa cartel, following the recapture of Guzman, also known as ""El Chapo"" (Shorty). He was arrested a few weeks ago after six months on the run, following his second escape from a high-security Mexican prison. According to Forbes Magazine, Guzman is the world's most powerful drug trafficker. The cartel is responsible for an estimated 25% of all illegal drugs that enter the U.S. via Mexico. Drug enforcement experts estimate, conservatively, that the cartel's annual revenues may exceed $3 billion.

"Zaur Dadayev shot the former deputy prime minister, a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin, in February 2015 near the Kremlin. Four others acted as accomplices. The group were allegedly promised $250,000 (Â£192,000) to kill Nemtsov. They all denied the charges. Nemtsov's relatives fear that whoever ordered the murder will never be found. Russian authorities are still looking for another Chechen said to be behind the killing, Ruslan Mukhudinov. He believed to have fled abroad. But lawyers for Nemtsov's family have said the investigators have exaggerated Mr Mukhudinov's role and ""the masterminds are high-ranking people"". The jury in Moscow convicted the five men after more than eight months of hearings. Zaur Dadayev is former member of an elite military unit. He was under the command of pro-Moscow's Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia's Chechen Republic in the North Caucasus. The other four defendants are brothers Anzor Gubashev and Shadid Gubashev, Khamzat Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov. A sixth man, Beslan Shabanov, died while he was being detained in Chechnya. Nemtsov served as first deputy prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, and later became a vocal critic of President Putin. The 55-year-old was shot dead on 27 February 2015 on his way from a restaurant in central Moscow. Earlier that day he was interviewed on a liberal radio station, in which he had called on listeners to join a rally. At the time, Nemtsov was working on a report examining Russia's alleged role in the conflict in Ukraine. President Putin called the murder ""vile and cynical"" and vowed to hold those responsible to account. Russia has seen several killings of high-profile politicians and journalists in recent years. But the country has a long history of prosecuting alleged hit-men and failing to follow the chain of command to discover who ordered the murder, correspondents say. It took the 12 jury members more than 12 hours to reach their verdict. They spent it in a closed room in one corner of the military courthouse with a guard posted outside the window. But when they finally filed back into court, it was to pronounce every one of the accused guilty. In each case they ruled by a clear majority. Standing opposite them inside a glass cage, surrounded by armed police and a Rottweiler, the men from Chechnya listened in silence, looking relaxed and even smiling as they had for much of this trial. There was speculation that one of the accused, Khamzat Bakhayev, might be acquitted for lack of evidence. When the jury found him guilty too, his wife burst into tears. But outside, lawyers representing Boris Nemtsov's family said they believe the trail of evidence leads to senior figures within Chechnya, loyal to Vladimir Putin.

"But none of the groups fighting on the ground have been invited. So absent from the talks will be both the Assad government and the Syrian political opposition, as well as the myriad other rebel militias fighting the Assad regime. Syria's Kurds won't be present, and of course jihadist militants of the so-called Islamic State (IS) won't be either. But the hope is that if outside powers can bridge their differences, it could be a first step towards influencing at least some of the warring sides. And some things have changed since the last abortive diplomatic push to end Syria's war: Iran's nuclear deal has made it a more acceptable partner to the United States and its allies. Russia has more incentive to push for peace: to keep its military involvement in Syria limited. The mounting refugee crisis has increased pressure on Syria's neighbours and on European countries too. And there is growing alarm at the way IS militants keep extending their reach. The focus (not for the first time) will be on how to agree a political process, including changes to Syria's constitution and new elections, to open the door to a broader transition. The main sticking point remains President Bashar al-Assad's role, and whether he should be allowed to stay or at some point be forced to stand down. So where do the most important countries attending the Vienna talks now stand? The United States and other Western powers (who held a pre-meeting in Paris to present a united front in Vienna) have shifted slightly recently. They no longer say Mr Assad must go as soon as possible, but rather that a transition must guarantee that he departs under a precise timetable. Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which had been insistent Mr Assad must go, may also be softening their position somewhat. The Saudi foreign minister on Wednesday still insisted he must step down, but within a specific time frame. But Russia and Iran, both backing President Assad militarily, claim he is a necessary partner in the fight against IS jihadists, and whether he stays or goes is not a matter for outside powers, but for the Syrian people to decide in elections. What is less clear is whether behind the scenes they are prepared to be more flexible, or less. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denounced elected leaders being ousted under pressure. He recently invited Mr Assad to Moscow to show him his support. But senior Russian officials have usually been careful to offer support to Syria's legitimate government, rather than Mr Assad himself. So would Russia support a compromise? Iran meanwhile has said there is no reason for Mr Assad to go, since he won re-election last year and his term should last until 2021. Will Tehran make him staying in power a red line? If there were no agreement in Vienna it would not be surprising, but it could also be dangerous. The Saudi government said it was coming to see if Russia and Iran were serious about a peace process, and if not, it would know not to waste time on them. Syrian opposition leaders have warned that if this week's diplomacy fails, it could lead to an intensification of fighting on the ground.","Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States have all confirmed they will be attending peace talks in Vienna on Thursday.","['The summary makes up the talks being on thursday', ""The summary states Turkey have confirmed it's attendance, but the text does not say it confirmed it's attendance""]",[],0

"Phillip Smith, 40, was arrested in a hostel in Rio de Janeiro by Brazilian police. He is expected to be extradited or deported. Smith used a passport in his birth name, Phillip Traynor, to fly to Chile and then go to Brazil on 6 November. He escaped while on a three-day release from a prison south of Auckland. Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 after he murdered the father of a 13-year-old boy he had sexually abused between 1992 and 1995. The family had moved house but he had tracked the boy to their new home in Wellington in December 1995. He repeatedly stabbed the father, killing him. The boy managed to escaped and raise the alarm. The victim, who is now 30, told New Zealand's Fairfax media after news of Smith's capture, that he could now stop sleeping with a knife under his pillow. ""It's great news, it's excellent,"" he said from his new home in Australia. ""[I feel] relief, a bit of peace of mind that I can carry on with my life without having that fear over my shoulder."" Smith's escape has thrown Corrections and various other government agencies into controversy. It has led to calls for an overhaul of short-term prison release and the monitoring of high-risk offenders. In an email Smith sent to Radio New Zealand he said he had planned the escape by running a criminal check on his birth name and discovering that it had not been red-flagged. ""My only anxiety was that somebody that knew me might happen to be at the airport at the same time to identify me,'' he wrote, according to Radio NZ. He also said he had been able to fund the escape with money from various businesses he had run from prison. Smith said he chose Brazil because he thought it would be more difficult to extradite him if he was caught, as the two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty. He was arrested after a member of the public in Rio De Janeiro recognised him from images being circulated in hostels and tipped off police. Smith appeared in court after his arrest and has been remanded in custody for 60 days. New Zealand Police Detective Superintendent Mike Pannett said in a press conference on Thursday that it was a relief to have Smith back in custody. He would not, however, say how long he expected Smith to remain in Brazil. ""New Zealand will bring him back as soon as possible but we are reliant on the Brazilian justice system to process and deal with the situation,"" Mr Pannett said.

"Special prosecutors said they raided National Pension Service (NPS) chairman Moon Hyung-pyo's home on Monday, before arresting him on Wednesday. The NPS is the world's third-largest pension scheme. It comes amid President Park Geun-hye's impeachment over the scandal involving her longstanding mentor Choi Soon-sil. In the latest arrest, investigators are looking into NPS's support of an $8bn (£6.5bn) merger between two Samsung Group affiliates and whether Mr Moon used his influence as health minister at the time, to pressure it to back the deal. The Ministry of Health and Welfare runs the pension service, which manages 545 trillion won ($451bn; £367bn) and was a major shareholder in Cheil Industries Inc and Samsung C&T Corp when they merged. The NPS has denied previous reports that Mr Moon pressured the organisation to back the deal, and Mr Moon told reporters on Tuesday that he would cooperate with the investigation. The scandal has also caught Samsung up in allegations that it backed foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil in the hope of receiving political favours, which investigators are also examining. Politicians voted on 9 December to impeach President Park - a decision South Korea's constitutional court has six months to uphold or overturn. Until then she remains formally president but stripped of her powers, which are handed to the prime minister, a presidential appointee.

"The Lib Dem MP for Bristol West said pubs in parts of the city were closing because of the decline of the ""white working class"" and the arrival of migrants from Somalia and elsewhere. He said reports of his remarks had been ""twisted"" to suggest a focus on race. He had simply been proposing derelict premises should be converted, he said. The comments were made as Mr Williams was outlining a government proposal to protect community pubs. The plan involves changing the law to prevent places listed as assets of community value being demolished or having their use changed without planning permission. Some campaigners had called for the government to go further and impose a blanket ban on the redevelopment of all pubs without planning permission. Arguing against a blanket ban, Mr Williams told MPs: ""In my own constituency, lots of pubs have closed - but it is usually because of demographic change. ""Some parts of my constituency, which had a 'white working-class community' 20 or 30 years ago, are now populated primarily by recently arrived Somalis and other people. ""Obviously the pubs in those areas have closed, and some have been converted to other uses, but some of them are still derelict. ""What the government is proposing is to look at the public houses that are genuinely popular and valued by the community now, giving them protection that is already allowed in the Localism Act and further enhancing that protection in terms of the planning laws, saying you cannot convert this pub into another use or demolish it without planning permission."" Some reports, including one in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, with the headline ""'Somali immigrants' cause pub closures"", had taken his comments out of context, Mr Williams said. ""There was no value judgement in what I said. It was simply an observation,"" he told the BBC. ""Some pubs in the Barton Hill and Redcliffe area of my constituency have closed because of the arrival of a non-drinking Muslim population to the area. ""I could have made a point about pubs closing because of the decline of a factory or a football stadium - both of which also apply to my constituency,"" he said. ""I was simply saying there was no point us giving blanket protection to all pubs, as some people suggest. ""But what we are announcing is powers for people across the country to protect their much-loved pubs by triggering a planning application if they are listed as a community asset."" Mr Williams rejected any suggestion his comments had been motivated by a negative view of migration. ""I have consistently argued that immigration is a good thing,"" he said.

The ICJ found only one act of genocide during Bosnia's 1992-95 war - the massacre of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) men and boys by Bosnian Serb forces in the town of Srebrenica in 1995.

At least 89 people were killed in the incident in rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun. Syria's government has repeatedly denied using any chemical weapons.

A number of casualties were treated at hospitals in Turkey, which opposes Mr Assad, following last Tuesday's incident in neighbouring Idlib province. The World Health Organization said their apparent lack of external injuries and similar symptoms, including acute respiratory distress, suggested they had been exposed to organophosphorus chemicals, a category that includes nerve agents.

"On Wednesday she was endorsed by John Warner, a five-time Virginia senator. She was also backed by the Arizona Republic newspaper, the first time it has supported a Democrat since its founding in 1890. Meanwhile Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, says Monday's debate has led to record fundraising for his campaign. Speaking on Tuesday night at a rally in Melbourne, Florida, Mr Trump said that $18m (Â£13.8m) had been raised in the day since the debate was held. The Trump campaign is planning to increase advertising spending before the election, and is reportedly considering asking the candidate to make his largest personal financial contribution yet towards it. In other campaign developments: . Senator Warner represented Virginia in the Senate for five terms between 1979 and 2009. He also served as Secretary of the Navy and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Speaking alongside Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Mr Warner said that he was ""distressed"" by Mr Trump's words, and that the Republican nominee does not have respect for the military. This is the first time he has endorsed a Democrat for president. Other Republicans to have supported Mrs Clinton include Larry Pressler, a former governor and senator from South Dakota, and former Minnesota governor Arne Carlson. Wednesday's endorsement by the Arizona Republic's editorial board is the latest from a typically Republican-leaning newspaper. She has already been endorsed by the conservative-leaning newspapers such as the Dallas Morning News, the the Houston Chronicle, and the Cincinnati Enquirer. ""Since The Arizona Republic began publication in 1890, we have never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president. Never. This reflects a deep philosophical appreciation for conservative ideals and Republican principles. This year is different. The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified,"" the editorial in the Republic, the state's largest, says. Mr Trump has yet to receive the backing of a major publication, with some papers choosing to instead endorse libertarian candidate Gary Johnson.

"A win over Motherwell was not enough and Foran, who wants to stay on as manager, felt let down by some players. The manager made reference to ""two or three bad apples in the dressing room"". And he added: ""I probably should have got rid of them in January. I stayed loyal to a lot of players and some of them didn't pay me back."" Inverness won three of their last four Premiership matches as they fought to finish in the play-off spot. But Hamilton Accies' 4-0 hammering of Dundee on Saturday ensured they will face Dundee United for a spot in the Premiership next term, while Inverness will play Championship football despite their 3-2 win over Well. ""It's obviously disappointment,"" Foran added. ""The best clubs in the world get knocked down, it's how you rebuild and come back. I've told the players there are far worse off people in life. ""But it happens in football. It is not all rosy. It is not all about winning all the time. I've been part of relegation teams - you stay loyal, you rebuild. You get knocked down, you get back up again. ""You need to get rid of the two or three players you don't want, that haven't given 100%, and I look forward to getting rid of those three. ""Of the starting 11 today, I would hope to have at least 10 of those for next season [midfielder Greg Tansey is leaving to join Aberdeen]. I am very proud of the players and when we got the right team playing, we could finish well, with guys giving their all for the club."" Foran, who was a player at the time, stayed with Inverness when they were relegated from the top flight in 2009. One year into a four-year contract, he hopes to do the same as manager. ""I want to be here next season,"" he said. ""I will have a chat with the board probably on Monday or Tuesday and will find out what their thoughts are. But I am 100% behind this club and I expect to be here next season. ""There are changes to be made, on and off the field. Personally I want a smaller squad. ""I have got to look at myself as well. I haven't performed well enough. I have learned a heck of a lot this season - about myself, about players, the trust of people around you, and people you don't trust. ""One of my favourite seasons as a player was getting promoted, because we stuck together. I was part of the relegated team and helped them come straight back up, and I hope to do the same next season."" One player who will not be there is Tansey, who signed a pre-contract agreement with Aberdeen in March. The midfielder, 28, was dismayed to leave on the back of relegation but felt he had given his all for the cause. ""It is never nice, but I can look myself in the mirror,"" said Tansey, who scored his seventh goal of the season in the win over Well, having scored nine last term. ""I gave all I could and have finished very similar to last season goals-wise. Sometimes things happen like that. You just have to move on as a professional footballer and get on with it.

"Media playback is not supported on this device . The previous highest chase by England at Lord's is 282-3 against New Zealand in 2004, meaning Alastair Cook's men are likely to face a record target. Asad Shafiq (49) and Sarfraz Ahmed (45) batted Pakistan into a strong position. England bowled well - Chris Woakes taking another five-wicket haul - but dropped two catches late in the day. Stuart Broad spilled a difficult chance to dismiss Yasir Shah (30 not out) at mid-off and then wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow dropped what was more of a regulation catch to end a punchy innings from strokemaker Sarfraz. They may also rue the moment Younus Khan, who put on 69 with Shafiq for the fifth wicket, had a leg-before dismissal reversed following a review with the score at 75-4 and Pakistan's lead just 142. Media playback is not supported on this device . Woakes was head and shoulders above the rest of his team-mates with the ball. The Warwickshire all-rounder started the day hoping to push England closer to Pakistan's first innings total of 339 all out. However, he was let down by his batting partners as England's last three wickets fell for 19 runs - leaving Woakes unbeaten on a well-constructed 35. He then shone with the ball, recording what are currently the second-best match figures (11-101) by an England bowler this decade. His expert line and length, which is delivered at a livelier pace than when he made his debut in 2013, saw him snare opener Shan Masood via a catch at first slip and helped him to pin Azhar Ali in front. He returned later in the day to bowl the obdurate Asad Shafiq for 49 and have both Sarfraz and Wahab Riaz caught behind with an outswinger and attempted bouncer respectively. England's batsman were bamboozled by the leg-spin of Yasir Shah in their first innings, with Steven Finn becoming the 30-year-old's sixth victim on a frenetic third morning. The odd delivery is beginning to stay low, while Woakes showed the benefit of a lively line and length on a sporting surface. History is also stacked against Alastair Cook's side. Their highest chase at Lord's is the 282-3 they scored against New Zealand in 2004, with the ground's highest successful fourth-innings total being the 344-1 hit by West Indies in 1984. Test Match Special's Geoffrey Boycott: ""You'd like to think England can do this. It comes down to how they play the leg-spinner (Yasir). ""The seamers will be decent like ours, but when the shine goes it's not easy. So they'll do their bit. ""But we come to the wrist spinner - if England play as poorly as the first innings, then it's bye bye. You want England to play better, but they need Alastair Cook to hang around."" Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur on Sky Sports: ""A lead of 300 would be very nice tomorrow. ""Misbah's innings in the first pleased me, Asad Shafiq has been amazing at number six, but I'm disappointed that none of our batsmen pushed on today.

O'Sullivan said: ""I tried my hardest but he was just too good,"" Selby, 30, is £300,000 richer for his Crucible triumph and is the ninth player to win the Triple Crown, having won three Masters titles and a UK Championship. Selby looked jaded on Sunday following his epic semi-final against Neil Robertson but managed to win the final two frames to stay within three of O'Sullivan, who wrapped up his last-four encounter against Barry Hawkins with a session to spare. He then won five of the six frames in Monday's opening session to drag his rival into unfamiliar territory, O'Sullivan having never before trailed heading into the final session of a Crucible final. Selby made breaks of 55, 52 and 74 - his highest of the match so far - to level the contest at 10-10 before winning a tense 21st frame to lead for the first time. O'Sullivan retook the lead after the mid-session interval, winning an error-strewn frame courtesy of a run of 50, but missed a simple pink into the middle pocket to clinch the frame after deciding to play it with pace. Selby duly cleared up before punching the air and ramming his cue into the ground in a mixture of relief and elation. Media playback is not supported on this device . Eight frames were scheduled for the session but it was a measure of the attritional nature of the action that they could only fit six in before the interval. O'Sullivan won the first frame of the evening session with a fluent break of 100, his third century of the match, to level at 12-12, but Selby won a 28-minute frame to restore his advantage before opening up a two-frame lead for the first time.

"Ingram made 101 not out off 47 balls and, although Wright later matched his score, Glamorgan won by 18 runs. Colin Ackermann hit a six off the final ball as Leicestershire edged out Lancashire in a thrilling finish. Surrey beat Somerset despite a 12-run over-rate penalty and there were also wins for holders Northants and Kent. A total of 66 sixes were struck in Sunday's five games, 19 of them in the Sussex v Glamorgan game. While South Africa's Test team crashed to a 211-run defeat against England at Lord's, it was a good day for some of their compatriots on the county circuit - especially those playing for Glamorgan. Chief among them was Ingram, who hit seven sixes to rescue his side from 7-2. He added 130 with former Proteas batsman Jacques Rudolph (49) and then 70 off the final six overs with Johannesburg-born Chris Cooke (37 not out) as they posted 198-3. When it was Glamorgan's turn to field, Ingram weighed in with the wickets of Ross Taylor and Ben Brown. And although Wright equalled Ingram's sixes tally in his 101 off 53 balls, he fell to another South African, Marchant de Lange, in the penultimate over as they came up short on 180-6.

But Surrey had reckoned without New Zealander Corey Anderson, who raced to a 30-ball half-century - and a decision by the umpires to award 12 penalty runs to the visitors because of their poor over-rate. Somerset needed 12 to win off the last over, but Anderson was run out for 81 - and innings featuring seven sixes - and Surrey scraped home by four runs.

""The other night, being on TV, there seemed to be a different kind of timekeeping taking place compared to this game.

As many as 15% of British motorists now use a dashcam, according to a poll of AA members, with one in a hundred planning to share their footage on social media like YouTube. Edmund King, the AA president, told The Times: ""While most drivers with dashcams fit them to protect themselves from 'crash for cash' fraudsters or dangerous drivers, there is an element of vehicular voyeurism from some individuals.""

"The requiem mass was held at St Mary's Church on the Melmount Road. The teenager who died in a water-filled quarry in County Tyrone is the third member of his extended family to die in a drowning tragedy. The body of Rhys Jack was recovered from the disused quarry in the Backtown area of Strabane on Tuesday afternoon. Parish priest, Father Michael Doherty, said both of the teenager's parents had lost family members through drowning. His mother lost her five-year-old brother about 40 years ago, while his father's uncle drowned in recent years. Father Doherty has been with members of the Jack family since the tragedy began to unfold on Monday evening. The 17-year-old was in the quarry with three teenage friends when they fell into the water from a makeshift raft. His three friends, who were later rescued, had frantically tried to save him. Father Doherty told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that Rhys's parents, Elaine and Mark, identified his body at the quarry shortly after it was recovered by search teams. He said: ""They knew over the past day, or from about eight o'clock last night (20:00 BST) that although they would have liked to have thought there was a chance he would be still alive, they knew that he was gone and their hope was that the body would be found sooner rather than later."" The priest said that their ""deep sadness"" at losing their son was mixed with ""relief"". He explained that the corpse of Elaine Jack's young brother had never been found, so they were relieved that Rhys's body had been recovered. He also said it was his understanding that Mark Jack's uncle had drowned in the River Finn a number of years ago. Father Doherty was the Jack family's parish priest and had baptised Rhys 17 years ago. He was also a chaplain at the teenager's school.

"The rebel, known as Roman Ruiz, led the 18th division of the Farc, which operates in north-west Colombia. The bombing was the latest in a series of attacks on the Farc by Colombian security forces. The two sides are holding peace talks but have not agreed a ceasefire. The Colombian air force said it bombed a rebel position near the town of Riosucio in north-western Choco province on Monday. Sources in the security forces later told local media that among those killed in the raid was Alfredo Alarcon Machado, better known by his alias, Roman Ruiz. However, Ruiz has been reported killed once before. Last year, sources in the security forces announced he had been killed, only for the head of the police to deny it later. Ruiz is believed to be the right-hand man of Pastor Alape, who is part of the Farc team negotiating with the Colombian government at peace talks in the Cuban capital, Havana. About 40 Farc rebels have been killed since the security forces resumed their bombing raids. President Juan Manuel Santos gave the order for the resumption after 11 soldiers were killed on 15 April in a Farc ambush in south-western Cauca province. The attack on the soldiers caused outrage in Colombia, with many questioning the rebels' commitment to the peace talks. The Farc had declared a unilateral ceasefire in December as a sign of its commitment to the talks. It argued the ambush in Cauca had been a ""defensive measure"" taken by its rebels as they came under pressure from the security forces. When the peace talks officially began in November 2012, President Juan Manuel Santos ruled out a ceasefire, arguing that the guerrilla had used them during previous negotiations to re-group and re-arm. In March of this year, he did however order the suspension of bombing raids. The peace talks have been going on for two and a half years during which the two sides have so far reached agreement on three topics on their five-point agenda. An estimated 220,000 people have died in a half century of armed conflict in Colombia. November 2012 - Formal peace talks begin in the Cuban capital Havana between the Colombian government and the Farc. May 2013 - A deal is reached on land reform, one of the most contentious issues. It calls for fair access to land, and rural development, two key causes of the conflict. November 2013 - The two sides agree on the political participation of the Farc should a peace deal be reached. May 2014 - Both parties pledge to eliminate all illicit drug production in Colombia. December 2014 - Farc declares a unilateral ceasefire. March 2015 - Both sides agree to work together to remove landmines. Colombia is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. April 2015 Government resumes air strikes after the Farc kills 11 soldiers in ambush. May 2015 Farc suspends its unilateral ceasefire after government military operation kills 26 rebel fighters.

"Lloyds Banking Group said the faults were not caused by any external upgrade work or cyber attack. Many customers found their debit cards were declined and about 3,500 ATMs were not working for three hours. The technical fault has now been fixed, and the banking group has apologised to those affected. The hardware failure came on a normal day for the banking group, it said. ""We were in 'business as usual' mode - and there was no maintenance or update activity on the system at the time,"" said a spokeswoman for Lloyds. By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter, BBC News . This is not the first bank to suffer from a computer failure, and it certainly won't be the last. New technology will put even more strain on the banks' creaking IT systems, which were built to run a very different banking system decades ago. So how do we cope as consumers? The irony is that the more we embrace the digital wallet, the more emergency cash we may need to carry for when these systems crash. ""We are working with our suppliers to understand what caused the hardware failure, but there is no evidence that it was as a result of an external intervention or attack on our systems. ""We continually review and update our systems as necessary and make significant investment to do this."" The chief executive of TSB, Paul Pester, said on Sunday that its customers' debit card transactions had been affected after problems with two out of seven IT servers. He tweeted an apology and replied to some comments personally. Lloyds Banking Group serves about 30 million customers and is the largest retail banking group in the UK. TSB has about five million UK customers and is in the process of being split from Lloyds Banking Group. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog, said it had been in contact with Lloyds and would be updated on how customers had been affected. Not everyone who tried to use their cards suffered problems, and Lloyds said that online customers were unaffected. UK banks have suffered a series of IT problems over the past few years. In December, an estimated 750,000 customers at the Royal Bank of Scotland group were unable to use their credit and debit cards for several hours. Leanne Seaward, 29, from Verwood in Dorset, said she discovered she had problems when she went to pay for her weekly supermarket shop at about 16.15 GMT on Sunday. ""It was a little embarrassing, I put my card in and it kept saying transaction void. I thought it was because I am in the process of switching banks, so assumed they might have closed my account without telling me. ""Luckily I had my husband with me so he was able to pay, but if I was getting petrol and on my own it could have been a completely different matter."" Your experiences . A week later, NatWest - which is part of the group - said that it was hit by a cyber attack. A deliberate attempt to disrupt services by creating a surge in traffic - known as a distributed denial of service attack - meant some customers struggled to access online banking. In 2012, a major IT failure locked many RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers out of their accounts for several days. The issue was particularly bad for Ulster Bank, with customers facing access problems for weeks. Most banks have seen online and card failures in recent years, with many of the computer systems being used dating back decades. TechUK, a trade body for a number of technology companies, said: ""It is now widely acknowledged that the technology infrastructure across many financial institutions is exceptionally complex, to the point where it no longer serves many banks, it hinders them. ""However many financial institutions are unable to address these issues because of the sheer cost and disruption that replacing these systems would entail.""",Thousands of customers of Lloyds and TSB were unable to use their debit and credit cards on Sunday.,"['The source text does not say how many customers were affected', 'Credit cards were not mentioned as being affected in the Lloyds event', 'It was not mentioned that the Lloyds event occurred on Sunday.', "" The summary states that TSB customers were unable to use their debit and credit cards, but the text specifies that TSB's issues were related to two out of seven IT servers and does not confirm that thousands of TSB customers were affected.

People have been protesting since Sunday over President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to stand for re-election in June. African news at it happens: 1 May 2015 . The government closed the university on Thursday citing ""insecurity"". Earlier on Thursday several hundred students tried to organise a march into the centre of Bujumbura. They wanted to stop the president from officially presenting his nomination papers to the electoral commission. The students told the BBC's Maud Jullien that the US embassy was the only place they felt safe and that they feared security forces were pursuing them. She estimates around 500 students are outside the embassy. The US has not reacted to their presence. Senior US diplomat Tom Malinowski met Mr Nkurunziza on Thursday, and afterwards said he had warned that the situation in Burundi was ""dangerous"". ""Some of the measures that have been taken... to shut down social media, to suspend radio stations not only are wrong as a matter of principle but very counter-productive,"" he told journalists. Rupert Colville from the UN human rights office also said on Friday that he was ""deeply concerned"" about the authorities' curtailing people's freedom of speech. At least seven people have died amid the biggest protests Burundi has seen since the civil war ended in 2005. In a Labour Day radio broadcast Mr Nkurunziza, a former rebel leader, warned of ""severe sanctions"" against protesters who are found to be behind an ""insurrectional movement"". President Nkurunziza said there would be a judicial inquiry into the protests. Under the constitution, presidents can only be elected to two terms in office but Mr Nkurunziza's allies say his first term does not count as he was appointed by parliament. Burundi's senate has announced that the constitutional court will examine the legality of the bid. Mr Nkurunziza has been in power since 2005, when a 12-year civil war officially ended.

"In the 1960s and 70s, the spirits of scores of convicted Japanese war criminals were ""enshrined"" there. The most controversial were the 14 ""Class A"" war criminals, including wartime leader Hideki Tojo, who were ""enshrined"" in the late 1970s. These men were the ones who ordered and oversaw Japan's brutal war in China and South East Asia. Yasukuni Shrine . It was a war in which millions died, in which there were widespread massacres of civilians, in which rape was routinely used as a weapon and where Japan used chemical and biological warfare against civilians. So if the shrine is so offensive to China and South Korea why did Mr Abe go? Firstly, because he wanted to. Close observers of the Japanese prime minister say he is at heart a nationalist and a historical revisionist. He believes the trials that convicted Japan's wartime leaders were ""victors' justice"". His own grandfather Nobusuke Kishi served in the war cabinet and was arrested by the Americans on suspicion of being a Class A war criminal. He was later released without charge. But the stain of association with Japan's war crimes in China never completely went away. Secondly, Mr Abe's support base comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party. According to Professor Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo, Mr Abe is ""showing he is a tough guy"", that he is not afraid of China. It is something that plays very well to his base. But there is perhaps a bigger goal that Mr Abe has in mind. He wants to radically revise Japan's post-war constitution. This, too, is a long-held dream that started with his grandfather in the 1950s. Mr Abe believes he is the man to complete the historic task of getting rid of the hated ""peace constitution"". Like many on the right here, Mr Abe believes that constitution was forced on Japan by America and is a humiliation. It imposes not only pacifism, but also Western notions of human rights and civil liberties. It rejects Japan's uniqueness in favour of ""universal values"". Mr Abe would like to change a lot of this. But it will be very hard. And so he will need some help. ""Abe has provoked China, and China has reacted just as Abe wanted it to,"" says Prof Kingston. ""There is a shrewd political calculus at work here."" What he means is that having an external threat in the shape of big and frightening China may be just what Mr Abe wants to help push through his controversial nationalist agenda at home.",Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.,['The summary states the shrine is in Tokyo and this is incorrect because the source text does not contain this fact.'],[],0

Stobaugh does not perform the song himself - on his original submission, he wrote: ""I don't sing, I would scare people, haha!"" Vocals are provided instead by Jacob Colgan, whose Green Shoe Studio organised the original contest. A documentary about the recording of the song, uploaded to YouTube in July, explains how the recording came about. ""What made Fred's entry so special to us was, one, it's an online contest.

"It marks the 20th anniversary since the start of the campaign to preserve Gwrych Castle, near Abergele. It was 1997 when 12-year-old Mark Baker began his campaign to safeguard the building's future. Since then he and volunteers have saved sections and signed a lease to look after a large part of the grounds. Gwrych Castle was built between 1812 and 1822 by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh as a memorial to his mother's ancestors, the Lloyds of Gwrych. By 1989 it was sold to an American and although there were plans for its future, it began to fall into decline. Travellers moved onto the site for two years before finally being forced to leave in 1997. Mark Baker, now Dr Baker, an architectural historian, said he felt compelled to try to save it after walking by it daily on his way to school. His campaign to set up Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust attracted the attention of the local newspapers and won support of community leaders. Today, the registered charity has a 25-year lease for five acres (two hectares) of the site. This has enabled it to begin restoration of the first section of the castle, the Countess's Writing Room in the Gardener's Tower. Although the formal gardens are regularly opened, from this month visitors can explore the grounds themselves for the first time. Dr Baker said public access had always been his ""main aim"".

"The hosts went ahead after 14 seconds when a poor Hugo Lloris clearance led to Jesus Navas brilliantly chipping in. Alvaro Negredo's shot went in off Sandro and Sergio Aguero turned in a cross to put City 3-0 up at half-time. Media playback is not supported on this device . Aguero again slotted in before Negredo's 18-yard strike and a side-footed Navas shot completed the rout. City have struggled on their travels this season but at home they have been an irresistible force and they were once again in sublime form at Etihad Stadium, where they have a 100% record in the present campaign with six wins from as many games. The movement and ruthlessness of Aguero, the invention of Samir Nasri, the midfield power of Yaya Toure and pace of Navas was too much for a shell-shocked Spurs as they suffered their biggest league defeat since losing 7-1 to Newcastle in December 1996. The defeat left Tottenham with just one point from their last three top-flight outings and the drop in form has put them ninth in the Premier League. Spurs had only conceded one league goal on the road this season - and six in total - but any hope they may have had before the game evaporated after just 14 seconds. ""Tottenham have taken a hammering from a Manchester City side who have achieved an emphatic win with an exhilarating performance. City have won six out of six in the Premier League this season and scored 26 goals in the process. They were brilliant from the start."" Lloris sent a clearance straight to Aguero and, even though the Tottenham keeper parried the Argentine's resulting 22-yard shot, he was beaten when Navas got to the loose ball ahead of Younes Kaboul and brilliantly scored with a first-time chip. The visitors tried to respond and City centre-back Martin Demichelis cleared an Erik Lamela shot off his goal-line after keeper Costel Pantilimon had missed a low Kyle Walker cross. However, that was as good as it got for Tottenham as City stunned their rivals. Aguero latched on to a Nasri cross and, despite Lloris getting a hand to the striker's chipped shot, the ball fell to Negredo, whose shot rebounded off Kaboul and Sandro on the way into the net. City right-back Pablo Zabaleta then released Navas on the right flank and the Spaniard's inviting low cross was expertly turned in from Aguero as the hosts all-but wrapped up the game before half-time. Media playback is not supported on this device . Pellegrini's side continued to dominate after the break and Toure played a one-two with Negredo before surging into the Tottenham box and squaring for Aguero to slot in his 14th goal in 11 games for the club this season. A Nasri effort came back off the crossbar before the quality of Negredo's finish for City's fifth then epitomised the home side's confidence. The Spain forward produced a drag back from Fernandinho's through ball to leave defender Michael Dawson trailing before rifling a shot past Lloris from the edge of the box. Pantilimon had to save an angled shot from recalled Spurs striker Emmanuel Adebayor but it was a rare chance for the visitors, whose misery was compounded when Navas raced clear and slotted in a sixth for City.

The key aim for the Conservative whips is to try get enough mainstream Labour MPs onside for the government's policy rather than relying on old Blairites to stick it to Mr Corbyn.

CK Hutchison, the owner of Three, said it was ""very disappointed"" the CMA had published the letter. The European Commission has until 19 May to make a decision on Three's proposed £10.5bn takeover of O2. Hutchison said: ""It is no surprise that CMA opposes the merger. It always has, and so has Ofcom. But it is for the Commission to assess any competition concerns, on the basis of the facts and proposed remedies."" Sky, Virgin, Tesco and UK Broadband have agreed to use Three-O2's share of UK airwaves to offer their own mobile packages, the company said. ""The entry of so many diverse, strong and committed players will ensure that there is plenty of competition in the UK market and plenty of counter offers to any supposed price increases post-merger,"" it said. Three's owner added that it would invest £5bn in UK mobile infrastructure and that new entrants would add a further £5bn. The planned purchase of O2 by Hutchison, which is owned by Asia's richest person Li Ka-shing, was announced early last year. If approved, the deal would leave just two other major UK operators: EE and Vodafone. Hutchison sent its suggested remedies to the European Commission last week to smooth the takeover. The CMA said the remedies ""fall well short"" and insisted the Commission should instead force most of O2 or Three's mobile network to be sold off after the deal. ""Absent such structural remedies, the only option available to the Commission is prohibition,"" Alex Chisholm, chief executive of the CMA, said in the letter to the European Commission. European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager will make the final decision on the deal, rather than UK regulators. ""At best we see UK deal approval odds at 50/50. The risk, here, is the decision could become increasingly political (from a UK perspective it already is) as it's so close to the Brexit vote,"" said Mandeep Singh, a partner at Redburn analysts. Campaigners for a British exit from the EU - known as ""Brexit"" - have already raised concerns about the European Commission having the final say instead of the CMA or Ofcom.

In a vote on 1 March, he will seek the support of deputies in a vote of confidence that the former ruling Popular Party (PP), led by acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, has indicated it is likely to oppose.

"The Japanese engineer created many popular drum machines, including the iconic TR-808. Its sound is a staple of hip-hop and electronic music, used by everyone from Kanye West to Marvin Gaye. Kakehashi received a technical Grammy in 2013 for contributions to electronic music technology. Dave Smith - Kakehashi's co-winner - told the BBC he ""was just an amazing man, a good friend, a very good competitor of course and just innovative continually all that time"". Before leading Roland for 40 years, Mr Kakehashi founded Ace Tone in the 1960s. The firm made amplifiers and primitive drum machines, laying the groundwork for the engineer's future success. The sound of the TR-808 proved a game-changer in the 1980s and 90s. It appears on Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"", and in the opening bars of Whitney Houston's ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody"". Rapper Kanye West's 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak showcases the machine throughout. Musicians have shared their tributes to Mr Kakehashi online, calling his impact immeasurable. Marc Almond of synthpop duo Soft Cell called him ""a man who changed music"". Martyn Ware, who played keyboards for The Human League, told the BBC: ""Roland was central to everything that we did for the whole of the first two albums - they featured on every track."" ""We were loyal to them like people would be loyal to a football team."" In 2015 the TR-808 was the subject of a documentary featuring Pharrell Williams, Fatboy Slim, and Phil Collins - among many others.

"Seema Malhotra formally complained to Commons Speaker John Bercow, saying the ""privacy, security and confidentiality"" of her MP's office had been violated. She also said her staff had felt ""harassed, intimidated and insecure"". A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said an aide had been checking when the office would be vacated, and denied intimidation. Ms Malhotra resigned as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury last month in protest at Mr Corbyn's leadership and is now backing leadership challenger Owen Smith. In a statement, Ms Malhotra said staff working for Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell had gained ""unauthorised entry into my office in parliament"". The MP for Feltham and Heston described several incidents when people from the leader's office used digital keys to open the office door. ""The implications of this are extremely serious,"" she said.

"The fire swept through the secondary school dorm in Aladag in Adana province and authorities said it may have been caused by an electrical fault.

The dormitory housed girls from impoverished families in nearby villages, reports said. One of the girls who died was Zeliha Avci, 13. Her father was waiting on Wednesday for the authorities to allow him to collect her body for burial in her village. ""No-one has called me,"" Mustafa Avci complained. ""We learned about the fire from the news and ran to the scene. Our children have been burnt to death and no-one gives us any information."" Mr Avci last saw his daughter at the weekend.

"Their study of more than 7,000 people suggests exposure to bleach and other chemicals is a factor in one in six cases of adult-onset asthma among British people in their mid-50s . The study, in Thorax, identified 18 high-risk jobs - four of which involved cleaning. Top of the list were farmers, followed by aircraft mechanics and typesetters. General cleaners, office cleaners, domestic helpers and care workers all featured on the list. So too did hairdressers and laundry workers. Experts say a person's working environment is to blame rather than their occupation per se. Hundreds of occupational agents have been linked to asthma. This includes flour and grain as well as detergents. Fine particles can be inhaled into the airways and cause irritation. Lead researcher Dr Rebecca Ghosh said cleaning products were starting to be recognised as a potential cause of asthma. She said there were specific Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) guidelines relating to cleaning products. Employers are expected to control exposures to hazardous substances and report any cases of occupational asthma. ""Occupational asthma is widely under-recognised by employers, employees and healthcare professionals. Raising awareness that this is an almost entirely preventable disease would be a major step in reducing its incidence,"" Dr Ghosh said. Malayka Rahman, of Asthma UK, said: ""We advise anyone who works in the industries highlighted in this study and who have experienced breathing problems to discuss this with their GP, and we urge healthcare professionals to make sure they consider possible occupational causes in adult-onset asthma and tailor their advice to people with asthma accordingly.""","Cleaning products may be a risk factor for asthma, according to researchers at the University of Bristol.",['The summary states the study was done by the University of Bristol and that information was not given in the source text.'],[],0
"Kevin McKearney and his elderly uncle Jack McKearney were shot at their family shop in County Tyrone in 1992 by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Their family has welcomed the report by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET). The HET found no evidence of security force collusion but also said it could not allay the family's suspicions. The report has identified eight areas of concern about the security force operation, both in the lead up to and the aftermath of the murders. The McKearney family were well-known in Republican circles and felt they were particularly vulnerable to attack. Days before the murders, Kevin's mother Maura had received a telephone call threatening that three men ""in white coats"" would be killed in Moy Square. The family, several of whom wore white coats while working at the butchers shop they owned in the centre of the County Tyrone village, reported the call to police through a local councillor. The HET report has concluded that the RUC ""did not formally record or investigate the reported death threat"". It stated that the McKearney family were given no police advice about their personal security after they were threatened. The inquiries team also said that the loss of forensic material during the RUC investigation, and the ""fact that a special branch officer was aware of the getaway car three minutes after the murders"" remained unexplained. Kevin McKearney, a father of four, was working behind the counter of the butcher shop on 3 January 1992 when a gunman walked in a shot him several times. The 32 year old died at the scene. His 68-year-old uncle John McKearney - known as Jack - was shot and seriously wounded in the attack. He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries three months later on 4 April 1992. The murders took place two weeks after a Protestant man was shot dead by Republican paramilitaries at his family's shop in the same village. Robin Farmer, the 19-year-old son of a policeman, was murdered on 21 December 1991 by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). The HET report stated Mr Farmer's murder had ""raised fears among the Catholic community in Moy of a retaliatory attack because of the history of tit-for-tat sectarian murders in mid-Ulster throughout the Troubles"". Mrs McKearney received the death threat from anonymous caller just six days after the teenager was killed. The butcher shop murders were not the first time the Troubles had affected the McKearney family. Three of Kevin's brothers had joined the IRA. In May 1974, his older brother Sean McKearney died when a bomb he was planting at a petrol station outside Dungannon exploded prematurely . In May 1987, his brother Patrick McKearney was one of eight IRA men killed by the SAS when they tried to attack Loughall police station in County Armagh. Last year, a HET report into that incident concluded that the IRA opened fire first. A third brother, Tommy McKearney, was jailed for his involvement in the killing of a part-time UDR soldier in 1976. Tommy McKearney spent 53 days on hunger strike in the Maze Prison, and now works as an author and freelance journalist. At the time of Kevin's death, his parents insisted that he had no paramilitary links. He had worked at the butchers shop since leaving school. Among its conclusions, the HET report stated: ""Kevin and Jack were not members of any paramilitary groups. They were both completely innocent victims.""

"She also understands why athletes get into trouble because ""sometimes your mind isn't 100% as all you're thinking about is training"". According to the Daily Mail, Mo Farah missed two tests before winning double Olympic gold for Britain in 2012. The Mail says the second one came at Farah's home in February 2011, when he claimed not to have heard the doorbell. Nine UK athletes missed two tests in the same year as Farah did. Yet UK Anti-Doping chief executive Nicole Sapstead told BBC Sport that it is ""not common"" for an athlete to miss a test. Farah's gold medals in the 5,000m and 10,000m at London 2012 were among the defining moments of the Games. At the time, UK Anti-Doping rules stated that an athlete who missed three tests in any 18-month period could face a ban of up to two years. That meant Farah could have been ruled out of his home Olympics with one more breach of the regulations. The rules have since been amended and athletes who now miss three tests in a 12-month period can be banned for four years. Sotherton said top-level athletes are tested up to 20 times a year and have to know three months in advance where they are going to be. ""You are never free of drug testing,"" said the 38-year-old, who won Olympic bronze at the 2004 Games in Athens. ""I've been tested nine times in six weeks before - at my house, at the track, at my partner's house. ""But a missed test doesn't mean you are doping. It may mean you have been a little bit careless. That doesn't make you a drugs cheat. ""I was very organised and I made a slip of a number by one day. That's how a missed test can happen."" Sotherton's sentiments were echoed by Jenny Meadows. ""It is very difficult to work out where you are going to be three months in advance,"" said the former European indoor 800m champion. ""You do have to remember, of course, where you said you would be and make sure you are at that place. Even this week I was out of the house before my testing slot should have started."" While European and Commonwealth 800m silver medallist Lynsey Sharp spent one hour every day for two weeks sat in a Boston cafe while on holiday because the doorbell did not work in her rented apartment. ""There is not a lot of room for mistakes,"" said Sharp. ""I do think we have great system but it can make it difficult for athletes."" Michael Rimmer, who won an 800m silver medal at the 2010 European Championships, said he had missed tests in the past and has suggested athletes are tagged so the testers know where they are at all times. But Michele Verroken, a sports ethics and anti-doping adviser, said there had to be ""an element of surprise"" to testing. ""There is no obligation on the testing agency to test you in just that hour because athletes would manipulate the system and provide you with a clean sample,"" she said. Christine Ohuruogu, who won 400m gold at the 2012 Olympics, was given a one-year ban in 2006 for missing three out-of-competition tests. The independent disciplinary committee which heard the Briton's case admitted it was a ""harsh sanction"" for someone who had ""no intention of infringing anti-doping rules"". The ban was described as a ""much-needed wake-up call for athletes"" by John Scott, who was UK Sport director of drug-free sport. Sapstead believes that UK athletes are ""incredibly supportive of the whereabouts system"" despite the requirements placed on them. She claims athletes understand that it protects them and their sport.","Former Olympic 1500m champion Kelly Sotherton says athletes are ""never free of drug testing"".","['The summary is incorrect because it hallucinates that they compete in the 1500m.', 'The summary is incorrect because it hallucinates that the name is ""kelly"" ', 'The summary states Kelly Sotherton is a former champion, but the text says she won Olympic bronze, so she is not a champion']",[],0

"Lundy was found guilty in 2002 of killing Christine and seven-year-old Amber in 2000, and was jailed for life. But the conviction was overturned in 2013 by Britain's Privy Council after new evidence emerged. The jury at the High Court in Wellington unanimously returned a new guilty verdict on Wednesday, and Lundy was sentenced again to life in prison. New Zealand media reported that Lundy stood open-mouthed in the dock as the verdict was delivered. His brother, Craig, told reporters the ruling ""brings some form of closure"" for the family. ""For the past few months we have had to relive the moment we were told a despicable human being took the lives of our much cherished sister-in-law Christine, and our beautiful niece, Amber,"" the New Zealand Herald quoted him as saying. Justice Simon France said time already served in prison would be taken into account in Lundy's sentence. Christine and Amber Lundy were found dead at their home in Palmerston North in August 2000. They had been killed by multiple blows to the head from an axe or tomahawk. Lundy was accused of staging a burglary to killed them for insurance money. Police believe Amber was killed as she tried to run away after witnessing her mother's murder. Lundy, who was charged in February 2000, has always denied the murders, saying he was on a business trip in Wellington at the time and with a prostitute that evening. Following his first conviction, a group of supporters compiled a lengthy dossier questioning the evidence presented in court, including DNA samples found on his shirt which the prosecution said were Mrs Lundy's brain tissue.

"Gareth Clubb called for Neil McEvoy's Adjudication Panel for Wales hearing on 2 and 3 March to be delayed. Plaid's spring conference is being held in Newport on 3 and 4 March. The Adjudication Panel for Wales has been asked to comment. Mr Clubb said the clash ""could lead to an erosion in public trust"" in the work of the panel. Mr McEvoy, a Plaid AM for South Wales Central and the party's group leader on Cardiff council, is facing a tribunal over allegations he brought the authority into disrepute in his role as a local councillor. BBC Wales reported in January that the case, referred to the tribunal by the Ombudsman, apparently relates to whether a comment was made to a council officer in a threatening way. In a letter to the panel, Mr Clubb said the Fairwater councillor ""will be speaking at the conference and we would not wish his speech to be disturbed either by his appearance at a panel or by his having to prepare for an imminent hearing"". He said the case ""could have been heard at almost any point in November through February on a date that would not have conflicted with a critical date in the political calendar"".

"UK passport holder Lee Bo, 65 - also known as Paul Lee - is one of five booksellers who have gone missing. All five men worked for a publisher known for books critical of China. Activists fear they have been detained by Chinese officials. The Foreign Office said it was ""deeply concerned"". The disappearances have sparked fury from lawmakers and activists in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, adding to growing unease that freedoms in the city are being eroded, the BBC's Hong Kong correspondent Juliana Liu said. Mr Lee is the latest bookseller to go missing, after raising the alarm about four of his colleagues at publishing house Mighty Current, who disappeared in October. He disappeared last week and was last seen in Hong Kong. A letter faxed to his bookshop, apparently written by Mr Lee, says he travelled to China on his own and is fine. Activists believe the letter is genuine - but was written under duress. However, Mr Lee's wife, Sophie Choi, has withdrawn her request for police to help find him saying he has been in contact. She had previously told the BBC she was ""really afraid"" about his whereabouts. The 'unprecedented' case of the missing Hong Kong bookseller . Hong Kong bookstore disappearances shock publishing industry . Speaking at a news conference in Beijing alongside his counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Mr Hammond said he had raised concerns about Mr Lee's whereabouts. ""These people have gone missing. A Mr Lee Bo, who is a British passport holder, has gone missing and we have urgently enquired both of the Hong Kong authorities and of the mainland Chinese authorities what if anything they know of his whereabouts,"" he said. Mr Wang told journalists the missing bookseller was ""first and foremost a Chinese citizen"", while the Chinese foreign ministry has said other countries had ""no right to interfere"". But Mr Hammond said that any charges against Mr Lee should be dealt with in Hong Kong, not mainland China. ""Our view is that the Basic Law, the joint declaration, the principle of One Country Two Systems means that in a question of any breach of Hong Kong laws the question must be settled in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong judicial system."" Mr Lee's disappearance has sparked an outcry in Hong Kong, where some suspect he may have been kidnapped and illegally transported across the border to mainland China - in a process akin to extraordinary rendition. Activists believe he may have been detained because of a book about the private life of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The BBC's correspondent in Beijing, Steve Evans, said the booksellers had been publishing ""pretty scurrilous stuff about mainland Chinese politicians"" which was freely available in Hong Kong, but had been seeping over into mainland China. If they have been snatched by the Chinese authorities, that would represent a breach of the guarantees made by China to Britain when Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997, he said. ""It matters for Hong Kong, because if there is perceived to be an erosion of the rule of law, that throws into doubt the whole basis on which this system of one country, two economic systems, is upheld,"" he said.

"Mr Maduro issued a decree to convene a constituent assembly amid continuing anti-government protests. The president says a new constitution will bring peace to Venezuela, but the opposition says it is a ruse to delay holding elections. More than 50 people have been killed in protest-related violence since 1 April. Mr Maduro signed the decree at a rally attended by thousands of his supporters. He said the assembly would be made up of 540 members, some of whom would be elected at local level while the rest would be chosen from various groups such as students, workers, farmers, pensioners, and indigenous people. The National Electoral Council later said that elections for the constituent assembly would be held at the end of July. The move was immediately denounced by the opposition-controlled National Assembly. National Assembly leader Julio Borges called it ""nothing more than an evil announcement meant to divide, distract, and confuse Venezuelans further"". He said there would be more ""street action"" and called for a march opposing the constituent assembly to be held on Wednesday. Fifty-five people have been killed in protests since the beginning of April. The unrest was sparked by a Supreme Court ruling on 29 March stripping the National Assembly of its powers and transferring those powers to the court. The Supreme Court suspended the most controversial paragraphs three days later, but the ruling united the hitherto divided opposition and spurred them into action. The opposition says the Supreme Court ruling and Mr Maduro's call for a constituent assembly are attempts by the president to cling on to power beyond the end of his term in 2019. They say that he has become increasingly authoritarian since he was elected in 2013, blocking their attempts to hold a recall referendum and delaying elections for governors.

"It was opposed to the ICC trying Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta on charges of crimes against humanity, said Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. The AU would raise its concerns with the UN, he added. Mr Kenyatta, who was elected in March, is due to be tried in July. He denies the charges, which arise from accusations that he fuelled violence after disputed elections in 2007. Analysts say the charges bolstered his campaign in this year's poll, as many voters saw the trial as interference in Kenya's domestic affairs. He beat then-Prime Minister Raila Odinga by 50.07% to 43.28%, giving him a narrow victory in the first round. Speaking at the end of an AU summit in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, Mr Hailemariam said the cases of Mr Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto should be referred to the Kenyan courts. African leaders were concerned that out of those indicted by the ICC, ""99% are Africans"", Mr Hailemariam added. ""This shows something is flawed within the system of the ICC and we object to that,"" he said. The ICC had been formed more than a decade ago to end the culture of impunity, but ""now the process has degenerated into some kind of race hunting"", Mr Hailemariam said. It was ""chasing"" Mr Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, despite the fact that the rival Kalenjin and Kikuyu ethnic groups, who had fought after the 2007 election, had come together to vote for them in the March poll, he added. ""The AU is mandated by the assembly [of the AU] to take care of this issue, to present to the UN the core of this matter,"" Mr Hailemariam said. Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were on opposite sides in the 2007 election, after which some 1,000 people were killed and 600,000 people fled their homes. The trial of Mr Ruto, who faces similar charges as Mr Kenyatta, was due to begin this month but it has been postponed. A new date is yet to be set. The ICC insists that it acts impartially, and says it intends to press ahead with the case against Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto. Source: ICC factsheet . Kenyan lawyer Wilfred Nderitu, who represents about 150 victims of the violence, told BBC Focus on Africa he was concerned about the safety of witnesses if Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were tried in local courts. He also doubted whether Kenya's judiciary was capable of dealing with such complex cases, he said. ""A lot of judges don't have an international criminal justice background. Therefore, the technical expertise will be lacking,"" Mr Nderitu told BBC Focus on Africa. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir attended the summit, in defiance of an ICC warrant for his arrest. It was unreasonable for the UN Security Council to refer Mr Bashir to the ICC when three of its five permanent members - the United States, Russia and China - had either not signed up to or not ratified the Rome Statute which established the ICC, said AU Peace and Security Council head Ramtane Lamamra, Reuters news agency reports. ""How could you refer the cases of others while you don't feel compelled to abide by the same rule?"" he is quoted as saying. The ICC has charged Mr Bashir with genocide over the conflict in Darfur. He denies the charge, and accuses the ICC of being a tool of Western powers. Around 300,000 people are estimated to have died in Darfur since 2003, according to the UN. Earlier this month, Kenya's government wrote to the UN Security Council, asking for Mr Kenyatta's and Mr Ruto's trials be halted. The prosecution was ""neither impartial nor independent"", said the letter, signed by Kenya's UN Ambassador Macharia Kamau. Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were the ""glue"" that held the country together during the March poll, the letter added. The UN Security Council is able to defer ICC cases for up to 12 months.

"Jetstar and Virgin cancelled all their flights between Australia and Bali's Denpasar airport, hitting the school holiday season. It is the second day of flight disruptions due to continued eruptions from Mount Raung. Some of those affected by the Bali closure have been speaking to the BBC about their situation: . Erika Fitzgerald, who was on holiday in Bali, said she was due to start a new job near Sydney on Monday but will not make it back in time. ""My main concern at the moment is getting back for that,"" she said. Instead of flying direct, she is now trying to get on a flight to Singapore on Saturday then three connecting flight back to Sydney. ""If we hadn't taken the four flight option we wouldn't have been able to get back till Sunday 19 [July],"" she said. Janan Jedrzejewski said she had booked a Bali villa with a private pool as part of a post-breakup retreat. ""I wanted to go get my nails done and get mud baths and go back looking fabulous,"" she said. But when she arrived at the airport on Thursday night Jetstar staff told her the flight had been cancelled. ""I used to work for the airlines so take in my stride, [it's] better safe than sorry, but I'm trying to cancel my villa,"" Ms Jedrzejewski told the BBC. Jake Powell said he managed to get back to Australia but his parents are stuck in Bali for another 10 days and may not be able to make a claim for the delay through their travel insurance. ""[Mum] was supposed to fly back tonight to Sydney and catch a connecting flight to Newcastle so I could pick her and Dad up tomorrow at 1pm,"" Jake told the BBC. Wendy Robertson, 78, was hoping to return from Bali feeling relaxed, but has instead been stuck with little information about when she and her eight-year-old grand-daughter, Ashley, will get home. ""I have run out of my medications for blood pressure and diabetes,"" she told Fairfax. ""I have to take them every day, I only brought a supply for six days. ""I am in a hiatus. There is no information. All I got was a recorded message. I was told I can arrange to confirm my booking online but I am 78-years-old. I [can't] access online."" How long will this go on? Forecasters say the situation is somewhat unpredictable as it is a matter of waiting for Mount Raung to stop erupting. ""This volcano has been erupting for about a week and it's been streaming ash constantly,"" Chris Davies from Darwin's Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre told the BBC. ""It's not an explosive eruption, just a constant stream and because the summit is so high it doesn't take much ash to interfere with flights. ""The most dangerous aspect for aviation is that modern jet engines pull in so much air and the ash concentrates in engines and turns into a kind of molten glass. ""The ash melts, coats inside of the engine and affects fuel flow, so in the worst case scenario it can cause engines to shut off.""

"She found overnight fame on the sketch comedy series, and spent two years being doused with water every time she said the phrase ""Sock it to me!"". Carne was also known for her tumultuous relationship with actor Burt Reynolds, to whom she was married from 1963-65. The Northampton-born actress died on 3 September, reported The Telegraph. Carne's other TV credits included appearances in The Man from Uncle, Juke Box Jury, sitcoms The Rag Trade and Fair Exchange, and the 1962 comedy film A Pair of Briefs. The actress detailed her relationship with Reynolds in her 1985 autobiography Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl. In the book she confessed to several affairs and also described her long struggle with drug addiction. When she and Reynolds met she said they ""were immediately in love, so we immediately made love"", but they divorced in 1966, with Carne claiming the actor had become abusive. The actress - who was born Joyce Audrey Botterill on 27 April 1939 - was brought up in Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, where her parents ran a greengrocer's shop. She was a popular figure during her time on Laugh-In, but quit the show in the middle of the third series - around the same time Goldie Hawn emerged as the show's female star - complaining that it had become ""a bore"". Carne once described herself as ""a 1960s flowerchild who has refused to grow up. Mature and responsible are words I don't understand,"" she said. During her lifetime she talked of relationships with several well known figures including Vidal Sassoon, Stirling Moss, the actor Anthony Newley, Steve McQueen and Warren Beatty - as well as a ""meaningful relationship with a woman for a year and a half"". She married again in 1970 to Robert Bergmann, but they split six months later. While living in America in the late 1970s, Carne was charged with heroin possession and prescription forgery, but was acquitted of the heroin charge. She moved back to Northampton in the 1980s where she was later said to have lived a quiet life with her two dogs in the village of Pitsford.","Actress Joyce Carne, best known for her role as the Sock-It-To-Me Girl on The Laugh-In, has died aged 74.",['The summary gives an age for Carne that was not given in the source text.'],[],0

"Jiang Jiemin was removed from office due to ""suspected serious disciplinary violations"", state-run news agency Xinhua said, citing authorities. The term is commonly used to refer to corruption. Mr Jiang has not commented publicly on the allegations. Chinese authorities announced they were investigating Mr Jiang on Sunday. Mr Jiang was head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (Sasac). Formerly, he headed the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Four CNPC executives are also under investigation for corruption. Mr Jiang is the first member of the current 205-strong Communist Party Central Committee to face such charges and state media is presenting it as proof of the new leadership's resolve to clean up public life, the BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai reports. However some observers suggest that, whether guilty of corruption or not, there may be a political edge to Jiang Jiemin's downfall, as vested interests in state-owned industries have long been seen as opposed to economic reform, our correspondent adds. Chinese President Xi Jinping has described fighting corruption as a priority, warning that ""bribe-taking by some party members and cadres"" poses ""severe challenges"" to the Communist Party's rule. Several high-profile officials have been felled in recent months. In July, former Railways Minister Liu Zhijun was given a suspended death sentence for corruption and abuse of power. Liu Tienan, formerly deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, was sacked in August and is the subject of an investigation, state media say.","The former head of China's anti-corruption agency has been sacked by the Communist Party, state media say.","[""The summary gets Mr Jiang's previous position incorrect, he was head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, not the anti-corruption agency.""]","['The summary states that Jiang Jiemin was sacked by the Communist Party, but the text says he was removed from office due to ""suspected serious disciplinary violations.""

"Resuming on 43-1 after there was no play in the first session, debutant Eddie Byrom (43) and Adam Hose (48) put on 77 to take the score to 102-1. But Holland then dismissed Byrom, James Hildreth, Tom Abell and Steven Davies in a remarkable four-over spell of 4-8. He ran out Lewis Gregory before Gareth Berg (3-26) claimed two wickets, then rain forced an early close at 135-8. Somerset came into the day in a commanding position, having triggered a similar collapse from Hampshire with the pink ball under the floodlights in their first innings. However, the poor middle-order batting that has undermined their County Championship season came back to haunt them, meaning a first win of the season is now very unlikely. Opener Byrom, who had looked otherwise solid, chipped USA-born Australian Holland to mid-on and Hildreth went lbw for two before Abell and Davies feathered edges to Lewis McManus, both without scoring. Gregory was run out by Holland when he slipped trying to run a quick single, leaving Berg to pin Hose lbw and have Craig Overton caught at mid-wicket before rain prevented any play in the final session. Ian Holland told BBC Radio Solent: . ""It was a strange session of cricket. Obviously they had the momentum early and they got a decent partnership but we got a load of wickets in a hurry, so it's a decent end for us. ""It puts us in a strong position. You never know.

""It was so good to see Adam Hose and Eddie Byrom batting well and getting into a good position, then Holland came on and nipped it around under the lights and caused problems.

"Under council proposals, the 75 schools could have funding taken away for one hour of lunch staff per day, amounting to £2,200 a year each, according to figures obtained by Plaid Cymru. Plaid said costs could be passed on to parents - which is denied by the council. Caerphilly said it was one proposal as part of a drive to save £9m in 2016/17. A spokeswoman said ""extensive consultation"" had taken place with head teachers, adding: ""There is certainly no intention that any financial impact would be passed onto parents, or that the service would cease to be provided by schools."" The Labour-run authority said it was committed to spending an extra £1.9m on county borough schools in 2016.17. A cabinet report set to be discussed next week says the 75 schools may decide to use their lunch-time supervisor to undertake the cleaning task. However, if this happened, 75 posts (working on average one hour per day) would be withdrawn in ""a worst case scenario"". This would amount to 375 hours of cleaning lost across all schools per week and the work would be shared among the remaining staff. Plaid Cymru said the proposal would save the council £175,000 a year, which equated to around £2,200 being passed onto each school. It added that it would be based on how many pupils eat sandwiches. The party's candidate for Caerphilly in the assembly elections Lindsay Whittle said many parents give their children sandwiches as they cannot afford meals. ""It seems likely that this charge will be passed on to parents by many schools or pupils even banned from bringing lunches in,"" he added. But the council's cabinet member for education Rhianon Passmore said the suggestion was ""disingenuous and misleading"", saying Plaid was ""scaremongering"". ""Sadly, such claims will undoubtedly cause extra worry and stress for hard pressed parents and their children. This is wrong,"" she added.","School janitors in Caerphilly county borough could lose their jobs in a bid to save £175,000 a year.","['The summary states they are janitors, but according to the source text, they are lunch custodians', 'According to the text, they may not lose their job but have decreased hours']",[],0

Monbeg Dude finished third and Alvarado came in fourth. Aspell, 38, becomes the first jockey since Brian Fletcher on Red Rum in 1973 and 1974 to win back-to-back Nationals, while it was a third success for 79-year-old owner Trevor Hemmings, who has previously won with Hedgehunter and Ballabriggs. Aspell said: ""It was wonderful and we will certainly celebrate tonight. I asked some big questions, but he dug deep. ""We really refreshed and recharged his battery and I tried to conserve energy. He is all heart. All season, he has had hard races. Win lose or draw, that's the best ride I have had in the National. I just hoped his battery life lasted out and it did."" McCoy appeared well placed in the latter stages, but Shutthefrontdoor tired badly from the elbow. ""I thought from the third-last fence I was running on empty,"" McCoy said. ""I will miss riding horses and races like that. I thought for a long way he could win. It was my last National but was a very enjoyable one."" The Northern Irishman had said he would retire immediately if he had won, but the 40-year-old could now race on until the Sandown meeting at the end of April. Winning trainer Oliver Sherwood was in tears after his decision to run Many Clouds was vindicated. The eight-year-old was a disappointing sixth in last month's Cheltenham Gold Cup after winning the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in November and scoring at Cheltenham in January. Many Clouds becomes the youngest winner of the National since Bindaree in 2002 and at 11st 9lb, the heaviest winner since Red Rum. He also won £561,300 for Hemmings out of a total prize fund of £1m. About 72,000 spectators turned out on a sunny day at Aintree to watch the 168th running of the National. McCoy had been strongly backed in the lead-up to the race - with more money wagered on this National than any other horse race - and bookmakers had feared a £50m pay-out if he had claimed his second victory over the 30 National fences. Nina Carberry, the only female jockey in the race, finished 16th on First Lieutenant.

"Paul Thomas, from Telford, was jailed for 10 years in April for the manslaughter of his son Oliver Sargent. Oliver's mother Ashlea was convicted of causing or allowing his death. The infant could have been removed from his home had the abuse been recognised earlier, the review concluded. Oliver's parents, whose relationship was described in the report as ""unstable"", took him to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford on four occasions. He was was seen by a number of doctors there and one questioned if the injuries could have been non-accidental, but another, a consultant, accepted Oliver's mother's claim that he was a ""very active child who rolled on to toys"". The report, which refers to Oliver as Child B, stated: ""Although there is no guarantee, there is a probability that had health professionals been clearer in recognising that there was no plausible explanation for the injuries, Child B would have been subjected to child protection procedures and consideration given to protecting Child B by removing them from the home. ""Health professionals were in a position to raise concerns when Child B was observed to have bruising and occipital swelling. ""The parents either gave no explanation for the bruising or the explanation was questionable."" Oliver died in hospital on 27 July 2012, five days after sustaining a skull fracture during an assault. His injuries were consistent with shaking. He was not previously known to social care services or police, the report said. Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court were told at his parents' trial that Oliver had injuries consistent with a 40mph car crash. A post-mortem examination showed he had 13 separate marks on his body and face and had been subjected to at least one impact to the left side of his head. Further medical investigations discovered historical injuries, including two fractured ribs and a broken collarbone, all of which had healed. Paul Thomas was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter, while Ashlea Thomas was cleared of both murder and manslaughter. She was given a two-year jail term, suspended for two years, for causing or allowing her son's death. The report set out a number of recommendations for agencies. It said Shropshire Community Health Trust (SCHT) responses to bruising seen in young children must be improved, consideration should be given to seeing a child's father and injuries should not be seen in isolation, but considered with other concerns. In cases where a child has life-threatening injuries out of office hours, senior managers of children's social care should be alerted. The review noted poor quality in recording of injuries at Princess Royal Hospital and a lack of consideration of previous admission and/or injuries. Andrew Tapp, from the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, described Oliver's death as ""tragic"" and said a number of changes had been made. ""Among these changes, any incident where there is the suspicion that injuries may be non-accidental is recorded using a body map to show the position of the injuries, along with measurements and full details. ""A system has also been established to ensure clinical photographs are taken 24-hourly on the children's ward. This improved recording of injuries ensures a more timely referral to social care should the situation arise. ""Should there be any difference of opinion between doctors about the nature of a child's injuries, the opinion of a dedicated named or designated doctor, who specialises in child protection, is sought."" Andrew Mason, of the Telford & Wrekin Safeguarding Children Board, said GPs are now referring more people when there is evidence of bruising.

"New figures, published by KPMG, indicated 20% of employees earned less than the Living Wage - an increase of 1% from last year. But Scotland had one of the lowest proportions of workers paid below the rate, 3% less than the UK average.

The Living Wage Foundation sets its level based on a range of a cost of living measures such as accommodation, travel, healthy food and extras such as birthday presents. It has just risen from £7.85 an hour to £8.25, making it nearly a fifth higher than the current national minimum wage and more than £1 higher than the the new minimum wage premium for over-25s of £7.20 an hour, due to come into force in April. Glasgow University is the latest institution to become an accredited Living Wage employer . The research, conducted by Markit for KPMG, found East Renfrewshire had the highest percentage of workers earning below the Living Wage, at 32%, while the Western Isles had the lowest proportion at 11%. The median hourly wage was £11.76 in Scotland compared to £11.61 for the UK as a whole. Scotland's median wage per hour grew 1.5%, compared to 0.2% across the UK as a whole. It has grown from below the UK average to 1.3% above the average since the same research was published a year ago. The research also highlighted that part-time, female and young workers were most likely to earn below the Living Wage. Part-time jobs were three times as likely to pay below £7.85 per hour as full-time roles. For the third year, the research found that women were more likely to be paid below the Living Wage than men.

"Philip Hammond called for EU laws to be overhauled to make sure that people coming from Africa to Europe could be returned to their home country. Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn accused Mr Hammond of ""scaremongering"". Steve Symonds of Amnesty International UK described Mr Hammond's ""mean-spirited response"" as ""shameful"". ""Rather than throwing up the drawbridge and talking about how Europe can 'protect' itself from migrants, Mr Hammond should be working with our EU partners to ensure that people don't drown in the Mediterranean or get crushed beneath lorries at Calais,"" he said. Mr Benn added that Mr Hammond should ""think more carefully about what he says"". ""We need responsibility and international leadership from this government, not scaremongering,"" he said. ""Those fleeing Syria are desperate refugees from a country being torn apart by war."" Speaking during a visit to Singapore, Mr Hammond said: ""So long as the European Union's laws are the way they are, many of them will only have to set foot in Europe to be pretty confident that they will never be returned to their country of origin. ""Now, that is not a sustainable situation because Europe can't protect itself and preserve its standard of living and social infrastructure, if it has to absorb millions of migrants from Africa."" He said the problem had to ultimately be resolved by being able to return those who are not entitled to claim asylum back to their countries of origin - something Mr Hammond described as ""our number one priority"". This, he added, was key to resolving the ""crisis"" at Calais, where thousands are gathered in the hope of crossing the Channel into the UK. There have been increased security measures introduced in Calais in recent weeks, after hundreds of attempts by migrants to break into Channel Tunnel terminals. On Saturday, 18 suspected illegal immigrants were arrested after a lorry was stopped on the M1 in Hertfordshire. Mr Hammond went on to say more could be done to protect the Channel Tunnel from illegal migrants. ""Having reviewed the situation in the light of the crisis, it is clear that there is more that can be done to enhance the physical security of the tunnel. ""But we also have to work with our French colleagues to try to deal with the root cause of the problem. So long as there are large numbers of pretty desperate migrants marauding around the area there will always be a threat to the tunnel's security."" A new fence about a mile long, built to stop migrants from getting to the UK via the Channel Tunnel, has been built in Calais and was paid for out of Â£7m made available by the British government.","The foreign secretary has been accused of ""scaremongering"" after he said Europe could not cope with the influx of migrants.","[""The summary makes up that he's the foreign secretary""]",[],0

Prime Minister Theresa May also focused on the issue of independence during a BBC Scotland interview on Thursday.

"With more than 40 firms now offering gas and electricity deals it warns of the danger of one becoming insolvent. At present anyone who is in credit with their energy supplier could lose out. The watchdog wants the cost of a safety net to be paid for by customers, which would have ""a small impact on bills"", it said. Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, Rachel Fletcher, said: """"We are proposing a safety net to protect customers' credit balances in the unlikely event of a supplier failure."" Under current rules, if a gas or electricity supplier becomes insolvent Ofgem appoints a replacement to ensure that customers continue to be supplied with energy. But it warns that ""there may be financial implications for the failed supplier's customers"". That is because as direct debit energy payments spread the cost evenly across the year, customers are often in debit during the winter and build up credit in the summer. Ofgem reckons that a typical customer's credit balance peaks at a little over Â£100 each year. But it warns that without regulatory intervention, customers are unlikely to receive all - or possibly any - of their money back if their supplier fails. Some industries already have a financial safety net for consumers. If a financial services firm goes bust, for instance, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme protects people's savings with authorised firms up to Â£75,000. The scheme is paid for by a levy on all financial services companies. Meanwhile if a travel company collapses, customers are protected if it was a member of travel trade association ABTA. The scheme is funded through a bond on members. Ofgem wants similar protection for energy customers and is proposing to allow, on a case-by-case basis, the costs of reimbursing credit balances to be spread across all energy customers. ""This would better protect customers' money and have a small impact on bills,"" it said. The watchdog was keen to stress that it does not expect any suppliers to go out of business. ""These proposals are for reassurance and to give customers the confidence to shop around and get the best energy deal,"" Ms Fletcher said. But it points out that while competition benefits consumers, it can lead to suppliers to fail in the same way as companies can in other markets. More than one in six - 17.4% - dual-fuel households are now with an independent provider, according to research from Cornwall Energy.

His gang, active since 1993, were being charged in connection with nine murders, Xinhua news agency reported. It described the gang as one of the largest criminal organisations in China to be prosecuted in recent years. Liu Han has been detained since March last year. The Xianning People's Procuratorate in Hubei province in central China filed the charges on Thursday, state media said. In addition to murder and intentional assault, the defendants were also accused of illegal detention, extortion and casino crimes, Xinhua reported.

"Deborah O'Hara underwent an operation to remove a 8.7in (22cm) tumour at Coventry's University Hospital in 2015. A clip was inadvertently placed on one of her arteries which led to a lack of blood to vital organs. She died two days later. Deputy coroner Emma Witting recorded a verdict of death by misadventure and said it was a ""tragic loss"". At the inquest in Coventry, surgeon Anthony Blacker told the hearing it was a complicated operation over six hours and when the tumour was removed Mrs O'Hara lost five litres of blood. In a bid to save her life, four clamps were placed on her arteries, but the move cut off the blood supply to her bowel and she died.

Brazil, Belgium, France, Greece, Mexico and Spain have been placed on a 'watch list' and must meet strict conditions by March 2016 or face similar action. Meanwhile, Kenya has been ordered to explain its doping controls or join those countries under scrutiny. Wada said that if Kenya's answers are ""unsatisfactory"", it could also face sanctions. There are 15 Kenyans currently banned for doping by athletics' governing body the IAAF. The ""non-compliant"" countries have failed to respond fully to Wada's request for information and Argentina, Bolivia and Ukraine have been found to be using non-accredited laboratories, which is a breach of the code. Andorra and Israel did not have correct rules in place. Drug testing will continue, but it will be carried out independently and the country in question will foot the bill. This will continue until the country reinstalls quality anti-doping programmes. Wada cannot prevent athletes from ""non-compliant"" countries competing - such a decision is taken by organisations such as the IAAF and International Olympic Committee. Russia's athletics federation is already provisionally banned from international competition for its alleged involvement in widespread doping. The IAAF imposed the sanction after a Wada independent commission report accused the country of ""state-sponsored doping"".

""In a sense, I don't care whether you're there with clean athletes if the only reason is fear of getting caught, as opposed to thinking that's the right thing to do. Listen, Russia built Sochi in seven years. This is child's play."" The country's Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said Russian athletics will co-operate ""in any way"" to prove it is clean. Pound's report stated Russia was not the only country with anti-doping issues, and that athletics was not the only sport with those problems.

The head of Kenya's Olympic committee, Kipchoge Keino, has accused his government of complacency.

"Daniel Sanzone was jailed for life after shaking two-week-old Joshua Millinson in Wolverhampton in 2015. However, there was no evidence injuries that caused his death could have been anticipated, a safeguarding board said. But it said staff were not questioning enough of the ""concerning history"" given by his parents. Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country . The review looked at two visits to New Cross Hospital's emergency unit by Joshua with Sanzone and the baby's mother, Zoe Howell, before the fatal shaking incident at their home in Pendeford. Sanzone's trial had heard a nurse and a junior doctor assessed Joshua and found no swelling and no pain but later bone experts suggested he had suffered some leg fractures at this point. However, the review found the fracture would have been very hard to identify in a baby so small and no X-ray was taken. But the report said the conclusion that there were no safeguarding concerns was ""reached too quickly"" on a second emergency department visit. It added although the evidence was ""it was carried out competently, too much reliance was placed on the medical examination"" of Joshua, which proved normal, and ""insufficient account was taken of the concerning and inconsistent history given by his parents"". The review, commissioned by the Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children Board, made a total of 12 recommendations on how various public bodies could improve their practices. It said the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust should review safeguarding arrangements in the New Cross Hospital emergency department and in antenatal services. Wolverhampton City Council should also audit the effectiveness of local authority child and family assessment, the report said. It added the National Probation Service in the Midlands should ensure risk assessments ""are updated when there is a change in the circumstances of a supervised offender which may indicate a heightened possible risk to vulnerable children or adults"".

"The £19.8m pre-tax loss for the year to May 2016 was largely due to cost of signing big-name players and a payoff for Brendan Rodgers, who was sacked as manager in October 2015.

The loss compared with a £60m profit for the previous year, which was largely due to the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona. The club also made £49m from the sale of Raheem Sterling to Manchester City.

"It came as figures obtained by BBC Radio Wales showed 15% of medical positions were vacant or filled by temporary staff. In the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, one in 10 of the medical staff positions were vacant. The Welsh government said there were difficulties recruiting A&E doctors. BBC Radio Wales submitted Freedom of Information requests to the seven boards in Wales asking about staff levels for consultants, doctors and nurses. All responded for the 11 months to August 2013 and showed that all the A&E wards were regularly operating below agreed staff levels. The worst was Aneurin Bevan University Health Board in south east Wales, where one in 10 of the medical staff positions were vacant.

We've essentially reached a tipping point in our staffing levels. Some departments you cannot deliver what you want to for patients,"" he said. ""Sometimes you can't deliver the quality and certain times we can't deliver the safety we require either which can be difficult."" Across Wales, more than 15% or almost one in seven positions at A&Es were either vacant or being filled by temporary staff. However the average NHS vacancy rate was more than 5% which is less than the English NHS rate of 9%. In September the Auditor General for Wales identified a deterioration of care at A&Es. Nicola Davis-Job, who represents A&E nurses for the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""If you have a nurse down on your shift and nobody to fill that the patient care level it doesn't go down, it just means that the nurses have less time to spend with each patient. ""You have to choose which patients that you're going to care for and that's not something that nurses like to do. ""They feel they should give dignified care to all those patients on their shift."" Responding to the figures, the Welsh government said: ""While just over 96% of all medical and dental posts are filled, demonstrating we do not have a general recruitment problem, there are geographical hotspots and recruitment difficulties in some specialities... ""If we want senior A&E doctors present for more hours of the week, we will only achieve this if we stop spreading them so thinly and focus their working in fewer centres."" Health Minister Mark Drakeford added: ""Right across the United Kingdom there is a shortage of senior doctors to work in A&E departments and Wales is no exception.""

"The weapons were intended for Syrian Kurdish fighters. Small arms, ammunition and other weaponry were dropped in 28 bundles on Monday by the US to help those defending the town of Kobane from IS. A US spokesman said 26 of the dropped equipment ended up in the right hands. The Pentagon says one bundle of weapons was taken by IS fighters while a second stray bundle was destroyed in an air strike. So how did it happen? And could the same mistake be made again? Dr David Betz from the Department of War Studies at King's College London is an expert in strategy, insurgency and counter-insurgency. Newsbeat put these questions to him. Air dropping supplies to forces on the ground is never a first choice. It's costly relative to other means, and though it is a well-established and a long-practised technique, it is also relatively inaccurate, for obvious reasons. It's done when there is no other alternative, most often as in this case, because the supported force is effectively beleaguered. It would seem that Turkey is not permitting supplies to the Kurds fighting in Syria to cross its border. If it were it would be much simpler, more efficient, and effective to do it that way. Often. That is why it's a last resort. Military history is full of instances of surrounded forces being supplied from the air. Think of the Germans at Stalingrad surrounded by the Russians in the winter of 1942-43, the British paras at Arnhem in the Netherlands surrounded by German forces in 1944, American marines at Khe Sanh surrounded by North Vietnamese forces in 1968. Or in a slightly different way the Allied supply of the French Resistance throughout the war. Sometimes it works - often it doesn't. As noted above, it is a well established skill and no doubt armed forces have gotten a lot more accurate over time but there are inherent limitations of accuracy when dropping things on pallets dangling from parachutes into an active combat zone where forces are intermixed in close proximity. Undoubtedly they are deriving propagandic value from it, as the article suggests, but that is not to say they are making it up. I would say all of the above, of course. Weather, enemy action, pilot or navigational error, equipment failure... War is inherently chancy and it makes the simplest things difficult. I wouldn't necessarily characterise the drop as not going as planned. The planners would have known quite well that there was a strong possibility of some items going astray. In fact, they'd know to a good deal of precision what the per cent would be. It goes back to the previous point of having no better option. If the only way of getting however many tonnes of military supplies to the Kurdish forces was to drop them in a way that IS got its hands on a fraction of them it might still be judged worthwhile to do so.

"Ban Ki-moon said he witnessed a looting incident in Les Cayes, where he promised more aid to Haiti. He also urged countries to donate more. Officials says more than 1.4 million people urgently need humanitarian help. There are also fears of a cholera outbreak, with spikes in cases and deaths reported in the south west. The waterborne disease reached the island via Nepalese UN troops after the deadly earthquake in 2010, causing the deaths of nearly 10,000 people. Tensions have been high as help has yet to reach many families whose crops and water supplies have been destroyed. Haitian police and UN peacekeepers used tear gas to disperse a group of 100 residents who attacked humanitarian convoys in Les Cayes on Saturday. ""We understand the impatience and the anger of the population who are waiting for emergency relief. We are doing all we can to facilitate the arrival of the assistance soon as possible,"" Mr Ban said. He flew over areas hit by the hurricane alongside Prime Minister Enex Jean-Charles. ""I was very, very sad when we saw the complete devastation. But people the world over stand with you,"" the UN chief added. ""We are going to mobilize as many resources and as much medical support as we can to first of all stop the cholera epidemic and second support the families of the victims."" Some 120,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed when Category Four Hurricane Matthew swept through on 4 October with winds of 145mph (230km/h). Mr Ban visited a shelter in Les Cayes and told the displaced ""kembe fem"" in Creole, meaning ""hang in there"". In the town, one of the worst affected by Matthew, the streets have been cleaned and business have reopened. But power, transport and communications links are still difficult in other areas. Last week, Mr Ban called for a ""massive response"" to help the country, the poorest in the Americas.

"The director was handed the Against the Current award at the Off Camera film festival on Friday. The 81-year-old, who grew up in the city during World War Two, said he was ""extremely touched"" by the honour. He is due back in court in Krakow for another hearing on 22 May. Polanski has been wanted by US police since 1977, when he fled the country fearing a lengthy jail sentence after being charged with having sex with a 13-year-old girl. The Rosemary's Baby director was held in Switzerland in 2009 after travelling to Zurich to pick up a prize at another film festival, but the extradition bid failed and he was eventually allowed to return to his home in France. 1977: Polanski is charged in the US with the rape of a 13-year-old girl. He also faces charges of sodomy, child molestation and giving drugs to a minor. 1978: Fearing that he may face a lengthy jail term, Polanski flees to the UK and then to France. A citizen of France, he is protected by the country's limited extradition with the US. 2009: The US rejects Polanski's request for the case against him to be dismissed. On a visit to Switzerland later that year, he is at first imprisoned and then placed under house arrest, as the authorities consider a US extradition request. 2010: Swiss authorities decide against extraditing Polanski, freeing him from house arrest. 2014: Polanski is questioned by prosecutors in Poland, acting on a US request. He agrees to comply with the Polish justice system as it examines the matter. 2015: The director attends a hearing behind closed doors in February. He is due back in court on 22 May. If the US extradition request is approved the case will be passed to Poland's justice minister. During Friday's ceremony at the festival, Polanski also pressed his palms into plaster for the hall of independent cinema stars. ""This is my city. Years spent in Krakow undoubtedly shaped my artistic soul,"" said the director, according to Hollywood Reporter. Festival organisers said the Rosemary's Baby director ""defies labelling"" and has never followed fashion, according to Radio Poland. ""To American cinema he brought European doubts and non-compliance. To European cinema - American respect for the audience, discipline and professionalism."" Polanski has been to Poland several times in recent years and attended an extradition hearing there in February, which was held behind closed doors. The BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw said at the time that many believe the authorities will be reluctant to agree to the US extradition request, as Polanski is regarded as one of Poland's greatest living artists. He plans to make his next film in the country - an adaptation of Robert Harris's thriller An Officer and a Spy.","Roman Polanski has received a lifetime achievement award in the Polish city of Krakow, despite being wanted in the US over sex charges.","['First name was not mentioned in the source text', 'The summary states that Polanski received a lifetime achievement award, but the text says he received the Against the Current award, not a lifetime achievement award.']",[],0
"A first-half David McAllister own goal was all that separated the sides in a tight affair at Mourneview Park. Coleraine hammered Glentoran 4-1 at the Showgrounds with James McLaughlin scoring twice. David Jeffrey's Ballymena United ran out easy 4-1 winners away to Carrick Rangers to move into the top half of the table. Relive the action from Friday's Premiership matches . Despite suffering their first defeat of the season, Ards are still tied on points at the top of the table. There were few clear chances in the game, with defences on top before McAllister nodded past keeper Aaron Hogg and into his own net after 17 minutes of play. Crusaders and Linfield can overtake the joint leaders if they win their respective games on Saturday. The Bannsiders put four goals past Glentoran, who continued their disappointing start to the league campaign. Coleraine took the lead after eight minutes when referee Mervyn Smith pointed to the penalty spot when Elliott Morris was adjudged to have brought down James McLaughlin despite getting a strong palm on the ball. Neil McCafferty made no mistake from the spot by slotting past Morris, although the Glentoran keeper may feel aggrieved that he wasn't ready to face the kick. Three goals in nine minutes assured Coleraine of the points. Darren McCauley tucked home after being played through by Rodney Brown, before McLaughlin drove the ball home from the edge of the penalty area three minutes later. McLaughlin grabbed his second just after the hour mark to wrap up the victory, before Jonathan Smith fired home after some good work from Nacho Novo to give Glentoran a consolation goal. Defeat for Glentoran means that the East Belfast side slip into the bottom half of the table, while Coleraine's first victory of the season carries Oran Kearney's side up to eighth. Ballymena responded from last weekend's defeat by Ards in perfect style, putting four goals past Carrick Rangers. Allan Jenkins opened the scoring, slamming home from a corner after just three minutes. Cathair Friel doubled Ballymena's advantage on 22 minutes by heading in from a Tony Kane free-kick. Carrick Rangers were provided with a glimmer of hope when Alan Blayney picked up a back-pass and Gareth McKeown's free-kick rebounded off the United wall for Nathan Hanley to make no mistake from the rebound. Jonny McMurray scored Ballymena's goal of the evening, letting fire with a fine 30-yard strike which flew over Simon Steele in the Carrick goal.

"No suspicious packages were found and passengers were being allowed back in the terminal buildings. Earlier, flights were on hold after the airport received a ""very specific threat"" by phone at 14:00 (19:00 GMT). Local news channel KENS 5 reported that one flight was diverted, three cancelled, and 28 delayed. As the airport was reopened, officials warned there was heavy road traffic in the surrounding area. While the airport was closed local news sources reported that dogs trained to detect bombs raised suspicions over three cars in an airport car park, indicating there could be explosives inside. Airport officials confirmed that all three cars were eventually cleared. Meanwhile, passengers were herded onto the runways, away from the airport buildings, before they were taken to a nearby high school while the search was under way. About 2,000 passengers were cleared out of the airport during the evacuation, Fire Department spokeswoman Deborah Foster told the Associated Press. The incident was brought to officials' attention at about 14:00, and the airport tweeted confirmation that it was evacuating the terminal buildings at 14:35. San Antonio International Airport handles about 260 flights, carrying between 14,000 and 15,000 passengers each day, airport spokesman Rich Johnson said.

"Vicki Russell told the CBC that Air Canada bumped her from the 1 April Toronto-to-Miami flight that she had booked two months in advance. As a result she missed her connecting flight to meet the cruise ship. Ms Russell has since received C$800 (US$592; Â£463) compensation from the airline. She says everything went according to plan until an agent told her about two hours after she had checked in and received her boarding pass that the flight was overbooked and she did not have a valid ticket. Despite showing her travel documents and getting the tour company to email her trip receipt to prove her ticket was valid, the flight left without her. ""It was extremely upsetting,"" Ms Russell told the CBC. ""The woman could not have been more rude, hostile. In all my years of travelling, I have never had a travel person treat me so badly."" She was sent to Air Canada customer service at the airport to find a new flight to Miami. By the time she was seen by an agent, no flights were available that would allow her to make the connection. She also had to wait to get back her checked luggage. She filed a complaint for missing her ""dream vacation"" with Air Canada the next day. The $10,000 National Geographic cruise, organised by Lindblad Expeditions, tours the famous Pacific Ocean archipelago's varied islands and habitats. A spokeswoman for Lindblad Expeditions said on Friday they have been in contact with Ms Russell throughout the situation and have rebooked her expedition at no charge, including airfare from Miami to Galapagos. Air Canada confirmed that the flight had been oversold. But the carrier said their agents spent ""a great deal of time"" looking at options for Ms Russell, including exploring ""outside the box"" solutions for getting her directly to the Galapagos Islands despite her flight ticket being issued only to Miami. They noted they refunded her initial fare and paid compensation. ""This is a very regrettable situation and we are sorry this occurred,"" said an Air Canada spokesman in a statement. The practice of airlines bumping passengers from flights has been under scrutiny since the footage of United Airlines passenger David Dao being forcibly removed from a flight made headlines worldwide. Following that incident, Canada's federal government reiterated its pledge to table a passenger rights law this spring. It is expected to include compensation rules for those denied boarding due to factors within the carrier's control. The Canadian Transportation Agency receives an average of about 50 complaints a year from passengers saying they were denied boarding.","A Canadian woman says she missed her ""dream vacation"" after being bumped from a flight to the Galapagos Islands.","['The person is not confirmed to be Canadian in the source text', 'This specific flight was only going to Miami .']",[],0

"Official figures show councils reported 936,090 cases of fly-tipping in 2015-16, costing almost £50m to clear up. Campaigners say financial pressure on local authorities had resulted in waste collection services being cut. One council alone handled more than 70,000 cases of fly-tipping. The number of incidents in Enfield was equivalent to 216 for every 1,000 residents. It means it cost £8.24 per person in clearance costs alone. How do you stop fly-tipping?

"Richard Cushworth and his Salvadoran wife Mercedes Casanella say a DNA test has confirmed the boy they are raising is not their son. Local media say their child has now been found, after testing other babies born at the hospital on the same day. The doctor, who denies any wrongdoing, is being prosecuted by the authorities. At a hearing in the Central American country on Monday, a court ruled the case against Dr Alejandro Guidos should proceed and ruled that he could not leave the country. It also ordered that a new DNA test should be carried out following a request from Dr Guidos' lawyers. Mr Cushworth and Ms Casanella, who attended the hearing, had originally travelled to El Salvador in May to have their baby in his mother's homeland. But Ms Casanella says she became suspicious because the skin colour of the baby she was handed to take home was darker than that of the boy she saw after giving birth and their features were different. When the couple returned to their home in the US they eventually decided to have a DNA test which they say confirmed the baby was not theirs.

"Mr Baran thought up the idea of making communication networks resilient to attack or traffic surges by splitting the data sent over them into chunks. His pioneering work was carried out in connection with Cold War military research. It would later form the basis of the academic network Arpanet which eventually led to the internet. Mr Baran first put forward the idea of slicing data into ""message blocks"" and using a distributed system of nodes to pass them on when working at the Rand Corporation in the mid-1960s. In his initial conception, Mr Baran said the system would operate by what he called ""hot-potato routing"". The work was done as part of a project to keep telecommunications networks operating even if a large part of them was knocked out by a first strike nuclear attack. The system would be better able to withstand an attack because it lacked a central hub through which all data or messages passed. This work found new relevance during the early days of the Arpanet, a network designed to aid US scientists communicate and which laid the foundations of the modern-day internet. Contributions from British scientist Donald Davies led to Mr Baran's ideas being adapted into a technology known as packet switching. This cuts data up into small chunks that are then despatched around the network. ""Paul wasn't afraid to go in directions counter to what everyone else thought was the right or only thing to do,"" Vinton Cerf, one of the fathers of the internet and a longtime friend of Baran, told the New York Times. Mr Baran died at home in Palo Alto, California from complications caused by lung cancer. ""He was a man of infinite patience,"" said his son David Baran. He added that his father had recently shown him a paper written in 1966 which speculated about what people would do with the telecommunication networks in the future.

"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the German bank for the way it accounted for certain assets in reports filed during the financial crisis.

The bank said there was no reliable model at the time to value those trades, which were made in the aftermath of the credit crisis and the subsequent collapse of Lehman Brothers. The SEC said the risk for potential losses ran into billions of dollars - a risk which the SEC says was not properly reported to investors. Its investigation found that Deutsche overvalued the value of certain transactions designed to protect against losses on securities in the then highly volatile credit markets. The collateral covering the portfolio was only a fraction, approximately 9%, of the $98bn total in purchased protection.

"Several Australian bars have dumped Coopers Brewery after it was featured by religious group the Bible Society. The video shows two MPs debating their opposing views on same-sex marriage - which is not legal in Australia - as they clutch Coopers beers. It has led to claims Coopers is against marriage equality, a claim it denies. The backlash has gathered pace in recent days and, by Tuesday, a string of drinking spots in favour of same-sex marriage had boycotted the brand. The Bible Society posted the ""Keeping It Light"" video on Thursday. It features conservative MPs Tim Wilson (for same-sex marriage) and Andrew Hastie (against) debating the issue in what they call a ""civil and respectful way"". Coopers has since claimed it ""did not give permission"" to be included in the video. However, the brand recently celebrated the Bible Society's 200-year anniversary with a commemorative beer featuring Bible verses. In the video, Mr Wilson argues: ""I believe that it would be sensible to change the act that deals with issues around civil marriage to include two people regardless of their gender."" Mr Hastie counters: ""I'm for retaining the current definition of marriage, which is between a man and a woman."" Despite Mr Wilson's inclusion, critics interpreted the video as one-sided. One commentator said Coopers risked sponsoring a ""political act by a religious organisation"", while another said ""homophobia lite is still homophobia"". ""I have respected Coopers all my life, and it was crushing to realise that as a queer person, they don't respect me,"" wrote Chloe Sargeant for the Special Broadcasting Service. Opposition to the video has picked up steam since the weekend. By Tuesday, at least eight drinking spots in Sydney and Melbourne had publicly declared they would not stock Coopers. One widely shared video showed two people throwing full bottles in the bin. Luke Hiscox, from Sydney's Union Hotel, which plans to take Coopers off tap, said people were upset by the phrase ""keeping it light"". ""That irks people because for them it's not in the slightest a light topic,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think they really realised what they were saying."" Another venue, The Old Bar in Melbourne, said it would boycott Coopers because it was ""very obvious that our values are at odds"". In a statement, Cooper said it was not ""trying to push a religious message"" with its commemorative beer range. It maintained it had not sponsored the video. ""We respect the beliefs of our community and do not wish to try and change them,"" the company said. In a subsequent statement, it said it had cancelled the release of its Bible Society commemorative cans and would be joining Australian Marriage Equality. """"Our company supports marriage equality,"" Director of Corporate Affairs Melanie Cooper said. Bible Society chief executive Greg Clarke said the video sought to have a ""civil conversation on a serious issue"". ""At first I was surprised the reaction was so immediate and extreme, but then on reflection [I] wasn't surprised because this really seems to be how social media works at the moment,"" he told the BBC. Mr Wilson has described the boycott as absurd, saying it only proves the value of the discussion. ""I'm disappointed Coopers appears to have distanced themselves from a sensible conversation that they should be proud to align themselves with,"" he told news.com.au. Advertising commentator Jane Caro agreed the video was not promoting a view. She said same-sex marriage advocates were often suspicious of religious messaging. ""They have lost patience and lost tolerance for the idea that there should be mutual respect on both sides,"" Ms Caro told the BBC.

"The former Home Office minister said Labour must not be ""afraid"" of the argument and had a moral responsibility to talk about immigration reform. He also said UKIP voters were ""darkly pessimistic"" about their lives, whereas progressive politics was optimistic. David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed on the issue this week - with both attacking the other party's record. Official figures published in August showed UK net migration - the difference between those entering and leaving - increased by more than 38% to 243,000 in 2013-14. EU citizens accounted for two-thirds of the growth. The Labour leader has promised to bring in an immigration bill creating ""clear, credible and concrete changes"" within months, if Labour wins next year's general election. Mr Byrne - Labour's universities spokesman who was immigration minister in the last Labour government - told Total Politics magazine the party ""can win an argument on this, but we have got to have the courage to put it at the top of our list of things we talk about"". ""And we have got be honest about the realities,"" he said. And he cautioned politicians against ignoring voters' concerns: ""If people then sense that politicians are trying to duck the issue or avoid it or not confront it they are just not prepared to have that - and frankly, why should they?"" He expressed confidence that voters backed his proposal to exempt students from migration targets: ""People know that students are good for Britain, not bad for Britain, they know that they are critical for our future influence in the world."" The Birmingham Hodge Hill MP said Mr Miliband had to offer a positive vision to voters who had been attracted to the UK Independence Party: ""The curious thing about UKIP voters is that they have one big thing in common: they are darkly pessimistic about themselves and their lives and if you want people to vote for progressive politics, you need people that are optimistic.""

"Riot police in Rio de Janeiro had encircled the area early on Saturday expecting a court order to evict them. The building is meant to be demolished as part of preparations for next year's World Cup. Community leaders said they were ready to fight back with bows and arrows. Campaigners say the eviction and demolition of the historic building - Rio's former indigenous museum, built in 1862 - are unnecessary. The community, known as Aldeia Maracana (or Maracana tribe), settled in the disused building six years ago. 'Tourist attraction' Brazilian authorities say the area needs to be cleared for the circulation of fans during the 2014 World Cup. Rio's governor Sergio Cabral recently said the demolition was being demanded by the Fifa, the international football federation. But Fifa's office in Brazil issued a letter denying the claim, says the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio. There are plans to build a car park in the area. A nearby state school is also due to be demolished, despite protests by parents. Several matches will be played in Brazil's biggest and most famous stadium, including the World Cup final. When it reopens, in the next few months, it will have a total capacity of 78,000 spectators. Maracana will also host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Olympics. The old Indigenous Museum, which belongs to the federal government, is in urgent need of repair. More than 20 families live there, planting traditional herbs and tobacco. Campaign groups have tried to save it and keep the indigenous community where it has lived for the past six years. The community hoped to be able to showcase their way of life to tourists during the World Cup.

"Oxfordshire County Council spent £25m in 2014-15 on direct payments to support about 1,770 social care users. But an internal review has found ""insufficient controls in place"" to ensure money was not being misused. Payments were spent on utility bills, household repairs, food and parents paying themselves high salaries. Updates on this story and more from Oxfordshire . The report added: ""The deputy director has confirmed these example items may not be relevant to meet assessed eligible need."" The authority's website said direct payments were intended to pay for ""a variety of care and support services"".

""You must not use your direct payment to pay for [...] items such as food, drinks, utilities, gifts or for other everyday items.""

""Finance queries had gone unanswered and also questionable expenditure not challenged,"" it said.

"Two years ago, that border comprised two parallel dirt tracks, one on the Bulgarian, one on the Turkish side. Now a razor-wire fence, 1.5m (5ft) thick, welcomes would-be migrants. Thirty kilometres is already completed, while 100km more remains under construction. ""The purpose of the fence,"" says Philip Gunev, deputy interior minister, ""is to divert flows of migrants towards border crossing points where our limited financial resources allow us to protect European borders in a more efficient way"". Such official checkpoints, he insists, are safer for asylum seekers than trudging long distances, often with small children, over the rough, hilly terrain the fence now cuts across. Fixed and mobile cameras, mounted on four-by-four vehicles, complete the picture along the whole length of the border. In the past eight years, since joining the European Union, Bulgaria has spent €300m (£215m) of mostly EU money, reinforcing this border. Another €100m is available to complete the job until 2020. Only €2m will be received for the better integration of refugees in the same period. Krassimir Kanev, director of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights advocacy groups, is unhappy with the checkpoints. ""The only way to get through is to pay smugglers,"" he says, arguing that only the richer migrants get a chance to try. ""And there's nothing safe about being cramped in the hidden compartment of a truck in the heat of summer."" About one third of Bulgaria's migrants are caught on the border with Turkey, another third as they head north or west inside Bulgaria, and the rest on the Serbian or Romanian borders, as they try to continue their journey towards Hungary on their way to Germany. Bulgaria has one of the highest rates of granting refugee status in the EU. Refugee status means they also receive a Convention Travel Document (CTD) and under the 1951 Refugee Convention they can travel on to anywhere in the EU and stay for up to 90 days. In practice, few ever come back, travelling to Germany or elsewhere. At the Harmanli refugee camp in south-eastern Bulgaria, two police buses bring more asylum seekers. Children wave happily, adults look more concerned. Conditions here are much better than they were in 2013, when overcrowding, appalling sanitary conditions, and the alleged cruelty of guards gave Bulgaria a bad name. Some asylum seekers still express frustration at delays with their applications. A group of men hold up a snake they killed in the camp the day before. But most acknowledge a big improvement in conditions for the 1,600 refugees here. Bulgaria is facing growing pressure from Western governments to identify exactly who they do let in. Ninety percent arrive with no documents whatsoever because they were taken by the smugglers who brought them this far. In an upstairs room at Harmanli, officers from the Bulgarian intelligence services cross-examine the refugees, most of whom are Syrian Kurds. While Harmanli is an open camp, those deemed suspect are taken to a prison at Busmantsi, near Sofia, where they can be detained for up to a year, while more investigations are carried out. ""The most frustrating thing about life there was the waiting,"" said one former Busmantsi inmate, who asked not to be named. ""Your whole life is waiting. You know there will be an end to all this, and one day you will be out, but at this moment you have nothing to do but wait."" Are there radical Islamists inside the prison? I ask. ""People keep themselves to themselves. They only share what they have to,"" he tells me. ""But the radical mood among my friends is all about money, which comes mostly from Saudi Arabia. It has nothing to do with political or religious beliefs."" ""Don't link those fleeing terror with those who would like to create it,"" says Boris Cheshirkov, a UN refugee agency spokesman in Bulgaria. ""States can protect refugees, and address security concerns too, by screening and registering them early on.""",Bulgaria is building a fence along its border with Turkey to stem the flow of migrants and refugees.,"['The summary says the purpose of the fence is to stem the flow of migrants.

El Hadary is playing at his seventh Nations Cup and has won four titles. At this tournament he became the oldest player at a major continental championship, and on Wednesday he made his 150th appearance for the Pharaohs. It is remarkable to think he arrived in Gabon as one of Egypt's back-up goalkeepers to first-choice Ahmed El Shenawy, but injuries meant he was brought in 25 minutes into Egypt's first game. Since then he has been formidable, conceding only one goal from normal play - in Wednesday's semi-final when Burkina Faso equalised in the second half. And now a place in Sunday's final in Libreville, where Egypt face either Cameroon or Ghana, offers him a chance to become the first player to win five Nations Cup titles.

"Pembrolizumab is a treatment for advanced skin cancer and is the first medicine to be approved through the Early Access to Medicines scheme (EAMS), launched in England last April. The idea is to get pioneering drugs to severely ill patients much sooner. Drugs signed off through EAMS have been scrutinised by regulators, weighing the risks and benefits. A green light by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) means doctors anywhere in the UK can prescribe the drug in question before normal licensing procedures - which can take years - are complete. Melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the UK and kills more than 2,000 people in Britain each year. Damage to the skin by the sun's harmful UV rays increases your risk of developing this cancer. While advanced melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may not be curable, targeted treatment can ease symptoms and may extend life. Clinical trials of pembrolizumab, which is injected into the bloodstream, suggest it has great promise for treating advanced disease. The treatment is considered a ""next generation"" drug in cancer care, stimulating the body's immune system to fight the disease. It blocks a biological pathway that the cancer uses to disguise itself from attack. Clinical trials are still under way, although the drug has already received a licence in the US for treating advanced melanoma. Until now, UK patients would only have been able to get pembrolizumab if they were on a clinical trial. Another government scheme in England, known as the The Cancer Drugs Fund, pays for cancer drugs that have already been licensed but not yet approved by the NHS watchdog NICE. MHRA chief executive Dr Ian Hudson said: ""We are delighted to issue the first positive Early Access to Medicines Scheme scientific opinion. ""The scientific opinion describes the risks and benefits of the medicine and the context for its use, supporting the prescriber and patient to make a decision on whether to use the medicine before its licence is approved."" Emma Greenwood of Cancer Research UK said: ""Pembrolizumab is another example of the great progress we've made in developing immune treatments for cancer, so it's encouraging to see it being made available to patients earlier. ""NICE and the Cancer Drugs Fund only look at licensed drugs, so it's a step in the right direction in terms of patients getting access to new treatments faster. With this approach, relevant data will be collected and patients are closely monitored.

"The Welsh have never been involved in a penalty shoot out, which could happen in Saturday's last 16 match in Paris. Coleman admits it is impossible to replicate the anxiety of sudden death penalty shoot out. ''If it comes our way we will have to try and deal with it,'' said Coleman, who has a fully-fit squad after beating Russia 3-0 to top Group B. Individual players have penalty experience, including top-scorer Gareth Bale who scored from the spot in Real Madrid's shoot-out win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final in May. The current squad have been sharpening their spot kick skills in training, but Coleman recognises its limitations.

"Mr Osborne said the changes would allow councils to allocate more sites for building homes specifically for people who already live or work in the area. He said he also wanted to improve transport, schools and broadband in rural areas to boost the rural economy. But Labour said the plans were ignoring the need for more affordable homes. The chancellor wants to extend the government's ""starter homes"" scheme, announced before the election for brownfield sites, to some villages. The initiative offers young local first-time home buyers a 20% discount on the price of the property. As it stands, the discount will be offered on homes up to Â£250,000 outside London and Â£450,000 inside London. The measures are part of Mr Osborne's new rural productivity plan, which will be unveiled later. Steve Reed, Labour's shadow local government minister, said the Conservatives' housing policies had made things worse for people in rural communities. ""The government says it wants to build starter homes in rural areas but it seems these will replace affordable homes to buy and rent - starter homes should be additional to affordable housing supply not instead of it,"" he said. ""In many rural areas buying or renting a home has become increasingly unaffordable. Yet the government has undermined the provision of affordable housing at every step by watering down requirements on developers to build new affordable homes."" Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Osborne said rural areas were an increasingly dynamic part of the economy, with 60,000 people moving from the city to the countryside each year. He has pledged to continue to protect the Green Belt but said he wanted to ""make it easier for people to stay in their rural communities and for newcomers to settle there too"". He and Environment Secretary Liz Truss write in their joint newspaper editorial: ""For rural areas, we want better internet and mobile phone communications, better transport, better schools, better skills, better housing, better business growth and better local government. ""And we'll look at planning and regulatory constraints facing rural businesses. In a recent survey of rural businesses the main barrier to growth that most identified was planning restrictions. ""So for a start, we'll review rules around agricultural buildings such as barns to allow rural businesses to expand more easily."" The Campaign for Rural England said it welcomed the government's recognition that rural areas could boost the economy, but it voiced concern that the ""beautiful English countryside"" was at risk of ""inappropriate developments"". Planning officer John Rowley said: ""We recognise that providing the right houses in the right places that meet local need is a vital part of ensuring our villages remain vibrant and sustainable.

"But pay remains lower than at Aldi and Lidl and overtime pay on Sundays and Bank Holidays is being cut. Currently Tesco workers are paid £7.62 an hour, which will rise to £8.42 an hour by November 2018. The pay rise will put Tesco workers' pay above the £7.90 level that the National Living Wage is expected to reach by 2018. The National Living Wage is the effective minimum wage for adults aged 25 and over, and is currently £7.50. Those under the age of 25 are entitled to a lower minimum wage rate. Statutory minimum pay rates will continue to rise until at least 2020, according to recent government Budgets, and companies are planning for those changes, as well as striving to remain competitive with rivals in order to recruit and retain staff. Wage growth in the UK has been slow in recent years, but inflation has risen and other supermarkets have increased the wages they pay. Aldi recently announced a rise in hourly pay to £8.53 an hour; Lidl's website says it pays store staff £8.45 an hour. Tesco said it would increase hourly pay in three stages: to £8.02 in November 2017, then to £8.18 in July 2018 and to £8.42 in November 2018. ""This reward package sees our biggest investment in store pay for a decade, and gives colleagues a sustainable pay deal that rewards them for everything they do, while allowing us to also attract new talent,"" said Tesco UK chief executive, Matt Davies. The retailer said maternity pay terms had also been improved. But extra pay for Sundays and bank holidays will be reduced from time-and-a-half to time-and-a-quarter after July 2018. ""This is designed to meet the government legislative requirement around the minimum wage. ""As expected, most of the businesses who have had to face up to this rise have had to reduce premiums and other perks that employees benefitted from in order to meet the core wage rises,"" said retail analyst Steve Dresser.","Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket chain, says it will increase its hourly pay for store staff.","[""The source text does not state that Tesco is the UK's biggest supermarket chain""]",[],0
"Bertie Acheson, who was 72, died after a confrontation with the intruder at his home in Glenmore Gardens, Coleraine, in April 2012. Paul James Manolito Toland, originally of The Cedars, Antrim, had pleaded guilty to Mr Acheson's manslaughter. After his release he must serve a further four and half years on licence. Toland, a father of four, has 18 previous convictions for burglary. He was confronted by his victim after he broke into the couple's home to steal money. There was a struggle and Mr Acheson, who cared for his disabled wife Sheila, suffered a heart attack and died on his kitchen floor. Speaking after the sentencing, the senior investigating officer in the case said the Acheson family had been left ""devastated"" by his loss, particularly his widow. Det Ch Insp Ian Harrison said the fact that Toland was sentenced on what would have been Mr Acheson's 75th birthday had a ""double impact"" on the pensioner's loved ones. ""A person who I deem to be dangerous has now been taken off the streets and people can now feel safe in their homes,"" the officer said. ""Paul Toland was a predator. He preyed on the vulnerable and elderly and equally infirm couple who had been married for 44 years. His actions resulted in the death of Bertie Acheson, for just over Â£300."" An earlier court hearing was told that the couple were woken up by the sound of breaking glass in the early hours of 20 April 2012. Mr Acheson went to investigate. His widow later told police she overheard a verbal altercation between her husband and an intruder, during which money was demanded. Mrs Acheson claimed she also heard the sound of a scuffle and gasping for breath. She managed to raise the alarm, but when ambulance personnel and police arrived at the scene, her husband was already dead. Toland had originally been charged with Mr Acheson's murder, but at a court hearing in October, a defence lawyer asked that his client be re-arraigned. Toland told Belfast Crown Court that he was not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. He also admitted the robbery of Mrs Acheson, who had Â£335 stolen from her purse during the burglary. Det Ch Insp Harrison paid tribute to the courage and resilience of the pensioner's family throughout the ""long and protracted inquiry"". The officer said that Toland had been in the couple's house the previous month to repair a vacuum cleaner and had been paid in cash. ""We believe that Toland's greed brought him back to the house in the expectation that he could break in and steal whatever cash he could get his hands on,"" Det Ch Insp Harrison added. He appealed to the public not to store cash at home saying they were exposing themselves to ""unnecessary risk"". ""In memory of Bertie Acheson, and to avoid the pain still being suffered by his family, please do not keep large amounts of money at home,"" the officer said.",A 30-year-old man who killed a pensioner during a burglary at his County Londonderry home has been jailed for seven years.,"['The summary states the man was jailed for 7 years, but according to the source text he was jailed, but the only time frame given is the 4.5 years we will have to do on licence after his release', 'The summary misinterprets the location of the robbery ', 'The summary hallucinates that the man is 30 years old ']",[],0

""It is a tabloid smear and it has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen."" As evidence that Mr Trump planted the story, Mr Cruz pointed out that the only person quoted by name in the Enquirer story was Roger Stone, a former top adviser to the Trump campaign. He also noted that Mr Trump and National Enquirer CEO David Pecker are close friends. Ted Cruz came out swinging on Friday, condemning the Trump campaign in the strongest possible terms. Some of those terms may require additional explanation. ""He is a man for whom a term was coined for copulating with a rodent,"" Mr Cruz said of Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser. ""Well let me be clear, Donald Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him."" What? Mr Cruz is referring to an obscene rat-themed euphemism for political dirty tricks. Mr Stone is credited with coining the phrase. Mr Stone got his start in politics working for President Richard Nixon. He later lost a position with Senator Bob Dole after a newspaper columnist named him as one of Nixon's ""dirty tricksters"". Such tricks included ordering hundreds of pizzas to be delivered to rival campaigns, cancelling opponents' rallies, and engaging in deplorable behaviour while pretending to represent other candidates. Through the years, Mr Stone worked for various Republican politicians including Ronald Reagan. And he's never shed his reputation for hardball attacks. In a 2007 profile in the Weekly Standard, Mr Stone was dubbed the ""boastful black prince of Republican sleaze"". Asked whether he would still support Mr Trump, the current front-runner, if he won the Republican nomination, Mr Cruz did not answer directly. But the Texas senator said: ""I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and my family."" ""I had absolutely nothing to do with it,"" Mr Trump said in a statement. On Tuesday, the candidates, who had been on good terms earlier in the campaign, began trading insults on Twitter. Mistakenly believing the Cruz campaign had produced an attack advert about his wife Melania, Mr Trump on Twitter threatened to ""spill the beans"" on Mr Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mr Cruz responded saying his campaign did not produce the advert, calling Mr Trump ""classless"" and a ""coward"". The next day, Mr Trump continued, posting an unflattering photo of Mrs Cruz on Twitter.

"Nearly half the roughly four million children displaced in the region are not in school, according to a new report by the Malala Fund. They risk becoming a ""lost generation"", Ms Yousafzai warned. The BBC's Lyse Doucet was given exclusive access to the report ahead of its release on Friday. Ms Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban after campaigning for education for girls in Pakistan, has been raising awareness of the lack of education for Syrian refugees. A growing number of Syrian girls are already teenage brides, or working in farms and factories, our chief international correspondent reports from the Jordanian capital, Amman. Major donors are under pressure from Syria's neighbouring countries to provide substantial long-term support if they wish to convince Syrian families to stay in the region instead of heading to Europe. ""It's time for the world to match their commitment to get every Syrian child back in school,"" Malala Yousafzai told me in an email. The 18 year-old campaigner for children's rights will be attending the London Conference with 17-year-old Syrian education activist Muzoon Almellehan, whose family recently settled in the UK. ""My generation is not lost,"" she insists. But the longer Syrian children stay out school, the greater the risk they will not return. British officials say it is not a realistic goal to get them back in class by the end of the next academic year. But they are still pushing hard. UK International Development Secretary Justine Greening told me: ""We must ensure Syria's children do not become a lost generation."" According to the report by Ms Yousafzai's's charitable fund, donors have provided only 37% of the money needed to supply resources such as school places and teachers. It says $1.4bn (Â£1bn) a year is urgently needed to plug the gap. Ms Yousafzai has warned that children are being deprived of education at a time when they begin to form into future doctors, teachers, and engineers. The report comes ahead of next week's Syria Conference in London, where donors will be asked to pledge that all Syrian refugee children in the region should be in school by the end of the next academic year. But even Nordic countries, which have been taking the lead on funding, are indicating that they may need to divert money to educate Syrians arriving in their countries. According to Ms Yousafzai, neighbouring countries are already bearing too much of the cost of educating Syrian refugees.","Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl shot by the Taliban, has called on the world to provide education for all Syrian refugee children.","[""Yousafzai's first name was not mentioned in the source text"", 'The source text did not mention that the girl was a Pakistani ', 'The source text did not mention that the girl was a schoolgirl.']",[],0

"South Yorkshire Police inspector Stephen Ellis told how a crush started outside the stadium on 15 April 1989. He told the jury he feared someone would be killed before a gate was opened relieving the throng outside. Ninety-six fans died following the crush at the FA Cup semi-final game. Insp Ellis, who was in charge of officers meeting Liverpool fans as they arrived in Sheffield, told the inquests that at 14:30 that day it was ""just a normal football match"". He told the jury he had escorted a group of around 400 Liverpool supporters from Wadsley Bridge train station into Leppings Lane in time for the 15:00 kick off. But by 14:40, he noticed things had changed and it was ""mayhem"", the inquests at Warrington, Cheshire heard. He said: ""They were running towards me, away from the turnstiles, pushing their way through, shouting, screaming ""get the match delayed"" that sort of comment."" A group of officers on horseback tried to block access to the turnstiles, the jury heard, which was effective for a short while. At 14:46 a police Land Rover arrived in Leppings Lane, he said. Mr Ellis said he climbed on to the roof of the vehicle and shouted through a loudspeaker at fans to stop pushing.

He was pushing back with his shoulders and pushing back with his legs. ""He stood up with his arms by his side, unable to move, pinned up against the wall near the turnstiles."" He also saw a young fan dive under a police horse, he told the jury. ""He cleared something like three metres without touching the ground and landed on his hands on the other side and then climbed up and started pushing to try and get into the turnstiles."" The jury heard he was worried somebody was going to get killed or seriously injured and that even if more officers or horses had been deployed they would not have helped the situation.

"Charlie Alliston, of Trothy Road, Bermondsey, was 18 when he allegedly hit Kim Briggs as she crossed Old Street, east London, in February 2016. The Old Bailey heard a witness saw the cyclist fly ""through the air"". Mr Alliston, now 20, denies manslaughter and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving. In court, prosecutor Duncan Penny QC read a statement from eyewitness David Callan who said he was walking in Old Street at about 12:15 BST when he heard a male voice calling. ""It made me look up immediately, just in time to see a collision between a cyclist and a pedestrian,"" he said.

"Falls in clothing and food prices were the main contributors to the change in the rate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS said the rate was also affected by a smaller rise in air fares in June than a year ago. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he expects inflation to remain low in the immediate short term. But the Bank expects it to start picking up around the turn of the year. The rate of Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation - which includes housing costs such as mortgage interest payments and council tax - was 1% in June, unchanged from May. ""Inflation has continued its pattern of recent months, when prices have been very little changed on the previous year,"" said Philip Gooding from the ONS. ""The headline rate for June has dropped very slightly on May, back to zero, thanks to small downwards effects from movements in clothing and food prices and air fares."" The CPI rate has been hovering around zero since February, and moved into negative territory in April for the first time on record, dropping to -0.1%. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the latest figure was good news for consumers. ""With earnings growth currently seeing clear improvement and employment high and rising, purchasing power is currently in rude heath,"" he added. While flat or low inflation can be good news for consumers, a prolonged period of negative inflation is generally perceived as harmful to an economy. The fear is that people will defer spending in the hope that goods or services will become cheaper later. The current inflation figure is well below the Bank of England's target of around 2%. Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, fell last month to 0.8%. That was down from 0.9% and the joint-lowest rate since 2001. ""The data therefore raise questions over the whether underlying price pressures are really picking up to the extent than the Bank of England is anticipating,"" said Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at Markit. He said that attention would now turn to Wednesday's wage growth data, . ""The Bank of England needs to determine whether pay growth will continue to accelerate as firms compete for staff, or whether low inflation will keep the overall rate of increase below levels that would normally worry the monetary policy committee into hiking interest rates,"" he added.","The UK's Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate fell to zero in June, down from May's rate of 0.1%.","['The CPI was spelled out as Consumer Prices Index which the source does not bring the full name up.', ""The summary states that May's CPI inflation rate was 0.1%, but the source text does not provide this information.""]",[],0

The Lib Dem leader is campaigning in north-west England on Thursday. He and David Cameron are not taking part in tonight's BBC TV debate involving the leaders of other parties. Asked how he stayed positive after a poll suggested his party could be wiped out in south-west England, losing all of its 14 seats in the region to the Conservatives, Mr Clegg said the poll itself was flawed. The Comres poll of 1,005 adults across the 14 seats suggested a 13-point swing from the Lib Dems to the Conservatives, with Labour, UKIP and the Greens also making gains at the expense of Mr Clegg's party. But the Lib Dem leader told LBC radio the poll had questioned the equivalent of 72 people per seat ""without even mentioning the candidates' names"". ""Polls like that are just absolute baloney,"" he said. ""The bogus science from some of this stuff is just extraordinary."" He added: ""We will win so many more seats than this endless cottage industry of pessimistic punditry allows for."" His party says there are 20 marginal seats where a Conservative win, at the expense of the Liberal Democrats, would result in a minority Conservative government reliant on UKIP and DUP votes to stay in power ""an alliance that will drag Britain further and further to the right"". The Lib Dems have dubbed the alliance ""Blukip"". The seats are; St Ives, St Austell and Newquay, North Cornwall, North Devon, Torbay, Cheadle, Hazel Grove, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Solihull, Brecon and Radnorshire, Bath, Montgomeryshire, Maidstone, Chippenham, Berwickshire, Watford, Mid Dorset and North Poole, Taunton, Somerton and Frome and Oxford West and Abingdon. At a news conference in Cheadle, Mr Clegg said that would mean an alliance involving people who did not believe in climate change, wanted to bring back the death penalty and who were against gay rights: ""There's a real prospect that David Cameron may have to rely on those people to stay in Number 10."" Mr Clegg said he wanted to ""lift the lid"" on a ""genuine threat to our country"" - because he said moderate Conservative voters in marginal seats were being told if they did not vote Conservative, they would end up with a Labour administration propped up by the SNP.

"The shadow chancellor told the BBC Jeremy Corbyn had shown leadership by insisting the referendum result must be honoured and the UK should leave. But he said Labour would not back a ""kamikaze"" exit which hurt the economy. Some shadow ministers have suggested they would quit if forced to vote for kick-starting official EU exit talks. Dozens of Labour MPs who support remaining in the EU could be willing to defy the leadership if it whips them into voting for Brexit in the event of a Commons vote which could take place in the coming weeks. The government has said it will notify the EU of its decision to leave, beginning two years of talks about the terms of exit, by the end of March. Whether Parliament is asked to approve the Article 50 decision hinges on a Supreme Court ruling, due on Tuesday, into whether MPs and peers are required to have their say. The Labour leadership have been accused of ""dithering"" over their approach and are under pressure to clarify whether they will oppose the government's plan of leaving the single market and the customs union and restricting EU migration. Mr McDonnell said the debate was polarised between those who wanted to overturn the referendum result and, on the other hand, those who backed a so-called hard Brexit and saw the UK's future outside the EU as a virtual tax haven. Labour, he suggested, stood between these two poles and supported a negotiated settlement with the EU to protect jobs, wages and living standards. ""Jeremy Corbyn has taken a rather courageous position in that he recognises that you have to bring the country together at some stage and it will be over a traditional British compromise,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""Somewhere along the line there will be a sensible compromise and it will be Labour that is driving that compromise."" Asked whether Labour MPs would be whipped to support the Article 50 process, he said the opposition had made it clear all along the referendum vote must be honoured. But he said Labour would seek to amend any government plans to guarantee the fullest scrutiny in Parliament and enable MPs from all parties to ""influence the negotiations"". Speaking on Sky News, Mr Corbyn said he would ""ask"" Labour MPs to respect the result while asked explicitly whether Labour wanted to stay in the single market, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told the BBC's Sunday Politics that ""in terms of jobs and the economy, of course we should be"". Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who is now the party's Brexit spokesman, said Labour had suffered a ""catastrophic loss of nerve"" over Europe. ""This absolute lack of clarity from Labour on the biggest issue of our times - dithering helplessly in the middle of the road - is only going to make their fate even worse."" While he expected ministers to win any vote on Article 50, he told Andrew Marr he expected Theresa May to run into trouble if she ""digs her heels in"" in during the talks. The Lib Dems are pushing for the deal negotiated by Mrs May to be put to a referendum, saying the government had no mandate to ""yank"" the UK out of the single market. ""Whether we like it or not the single market, the biggest destination of our goods and services, is a market place of rules,"" he added. ""So even if we are out of it, we will have to abide by those rules. Once I think that becomes clear, the British public will start having some doubts."" The Conservatives, which have promised Parliament a vote on the final deal, said Labour remained ""hopelessly divided and confused"". ""They can't agree over whether we should leave the single market and have said they will also find new ways of frustrating the process of leaving,"" said Tory MP Maria Caulfield.","Labour will be driving a ""sensible compromise"" in the Brexit debate, John McDonnell has said.","[""The summary makes up McDonnell's first name""]",[],0

"The largest numbers of children rescued were in San Francisco, Detroit, Milwaukee, Denver and New Orleans. FBI assistant director Ronald Hosko said the Operation Cross Country VII raids had been the agency's largest action against child exploitation. The FBI said 2,700 children have been rescued in such US raids since 2003. The victims in the most recent raids were almost all girls and range in age from 13 to 17. They had been prostituted in a variety of locations, including truck stops, casinos, motels as well as on social media and online advertisements. Mr Hosko said the accused had preyed on vulnerable teenagers, exploiting them over a period of time. ""Girls are enticed with compliments or offers, [asked] do they want to make some money,"" he said. ""Then they are trapped into this cycle that involves drugs, that involves physical abuse. It may involve torture."" Since 2003, some 1,350 people have been convicted in such cases, including life prison sentences for 10 pimps, the FBI said. Assets of more than $3.1m (Â£2m) have been seized. The US justice department has estimated as many as 450,000 children run away from home each year. It says a third of teens living on the street will be lured toward prostitution within 48 hours of leaving home. Some lawmakers have said further legal protections are needed.

"In passing the law that allows legal action against Saudi Arabia over the 9/11 attacks, Congress over-ruled a veto by Mr Obama for the first time in his presidency. So why is it so controversial, and what are its wider implications? The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) was brought by the families of 9/11 victims, to allow them to sue any member of the Saudi government suspected of playing a role in the attacks. In practice, the bill permits civil claims against a foreign state or official for injuries, death, or damages from an act of international terrorism. Fifteen of the 19 terrorist who hijacked planes on 9/11 were Saudi nationals, and it has long been rumoured that senior Saudi officials were in some way linked to the attack. Official inquiries since 2001 have found there is no evidence of either the Saudi government or senior Saudi individuals funding al-Qaeda. However, a previously classified document earlier this year revealed ""while in the United States, some of the 9/11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support or assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi government"". While the document did not provide any direct evidence of top-level Saudi involvement, it did raise new questions. A veto is one of the most significant tools an American president has at his disposal, and has been used more than 2,500 times in America's history to prevent the passage of legislation. According to the US' House of Representatives, even the threat of a veto can bring about changes. Congress can overrule a veto however - but only if it has the support of two-thirds of the House and Senate. This has only happened on 110 occasions since 1792. Despite this, it is unusual for a president in recent years to get through two terms without congress overruling a veto. George W Bush had four overturned, while Bill Clinton had two during his tenure. The last presidency to go unchallenged was that of Lyndon B Johnson. President Barack Obama, who has only used a veto on 12 occasions and had, until now, never had one overruled, fears the amended law will leave America open to similar suits from other countries - especially as there is little consensus internationally on what constitutes an act of terrorism. Stephen Vladeck, professor of law at the University of Texas, explained: ""The real concern is that the more the US weakens the concept of foreign sovereign immunity, the more that the weakening will be used against it. ""President Obama is concerned that [something like] a drone strike against a suspected al-Qaeda target in Yemen or Pakistan or Somalia could very well be deemed by those countries as terrorism which could subject the US to significant liability in those courts."" But Terry Strada, national chair for 9/11 Families United For Justice Against Terrorism, has disagreed that the bill could backfire in the way the White House has warned. ""If we're not funding terrorist organisations and killing people, then we don't have anything to worry about,"" she said. The bill may also have an impact on relations with Saudi Arabia, a key ally for the US in the Middle East. Salman al-Ansari, president of the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee, said Saudi Arabia could reduce valuable security and intelligence co-operation as a result. The idea was to ""clear away"" obstacles and force an American court to answer whether and to what extent the Saudi government was involved in the 9/11 attacks. But Professor Vladeck says in its creation the bill has created more blocks which will ""probably"" lead to ""more litigation"". And even if the outcome is successful for the families, it will be little more than symbolic, he believes. ""The problem with JASTA is, it does not allow an American court to seize Saudi assets, or any foreign sovereign's assets, for this kind of claim,"" he says. ""So the best the plaintiffs can hope for is a piece of paper that says, yes the Saudi government was indirectly responsible because of funding, no you don't get any damages.""","US President Barack Obama has described it as ""one of the worst pieces of legislation that I've ever seen"".",['The summary states a quote from Obama not mentioned in the source text.'],[],0
"Drought has taken a savage toll on the town of McKinlay in north-west Queensland, Australia, so a downpour of rain just before Christmas was the best present he could imagine. Suspecting water would begin to flow on 18 December, Senior Constable Hansson drove to the riverbank and started filming when the water began to cut through the dust. ""Come on down â€¦ Come to papa!"" he can be heard yelling in the video. ""Here she comes... wow, I can't believe how lucky I am!"" His enthusiastic and very Australian response to the river's return to life would perhaps have gone unnoticed were it not for his daughter, Tahnee, who uploaded the video to YouTube on 19 December. This week the internet noticed it, and turned Snr Con Hansson into an overnight sensation. Speaking to the BBC from McKinlay Police Station, the straight-talking police officer said he was excited the river had run, but his chief concern was seeing the area emerge from drought. ""It's desperate times,"" he said. ""For about three months it looked like a desert, with no green grass left."" ""The ground was bare and a lot of our pastoralists had been hand-feeding the stock to keep them alive."" ""We had more rain across the Christmas season than we've had in the past two years."" He said he was so excited on the video because he had not seen the river flow since moving to the area four years earlier. ""I patrol the area anyway so I just pulled up for a minute to see if the river would start. I just couldn't believe it,"" he said. Living in a remote area which relies on satellite internet, Snr Con Hansson remains unaware of the extent of the video's popularity. ""My daughter's been keeping me appraised of the situation. She said she had uploaded the video to YouTube and I said, 'So what?'. ""But I'm excited people get to know about north-west Queensland and how tough it is out here, and how tough the people are.

"George Bender, 68, took his own life on October 14. He had spent much of the past decade locked in negotiations with CSG (Coal Seam Gas) companies who wanted to drill 18 wells on his properties. Encroaching gas exploration across Australia has pitted miners against farmers, who fear the environmental and health impact of CSG. Mr Bender's daughter Helen made an emotional plea on this subject on live television panel show Q&A. ""On Saturday we buried my father,"" Helen Bender said. ""When will farmers be given the right to say no to CSG companies?"" She spoke about how the issue had disillusioned her father: ""One of the last things my father said, 'No one is listening, why am I wasting my time?'"" she said. In response to her comments Australia's rural health minister said she wanted laws to allow farmers to refuse miners onto their land. Senator Fiona Nash said the ""simple answer"" to the complex issue would be legislative change to empower farmers. Helen Bender's name then began trending on social media sites, a reflection of the potency of the debate among the Australian public. However, Federal Opposition Minister for Rural Affairs Joel Fitzgibbon who was also on the panel on the show said that Australia had enjoyed ""enormous wealth through the extraction of coal and iron ore and other commodities, and now CSG"". He added that it was a complex policy area and that responsibility for mining leases lies with individual state governments. ""In my view to be honest [it] is not going to change anytime soon because the extraction of those resources is too significant to the national economy,"" Mr Fitzgibbon replied.

A Crown Court judge branded the offences by her 30-year-old father as ""appalling"". He was given a 12-month prison sentence which will be followed by two years on licence upon his release. The 30-year-old man, who lives in the Ards Peninsula, was found guilty of two charges - being cruel to a child and causing her grievous bodily harm. He told the court he could not cope with parenting, and claimed that the more his daughter cried, the more stressed he became. Belfast Crown Court heard that the child's father has Asperger's Syndrome, which the judge accepted may have impacted on how he dealt with stress. However, the judge said that whilst his condition may be relevant to explain some of his behaviour, the offences were serious and as such attracted a custodial sentence. Also appearing in court was the child's mother, who was made the subject of a two-year probation order after she admitted a single charge of child cruelty.

"Seven of her relatives have been arrested, and accused of misusing their royal status to amass vast wealth and carry out numerous abuses. The crown prince himself has now made the disgrace official by ordering her family to stop using the name Akrapongpreecha, which he gave them after he married her in 2001. The king and the crown prince both have this privilege, akin to knighthoods in the UK. Interestingly, the crown prince has not revoked her royal title, ""Mom"", which translates roughly as ""princess"", nor yet her use of the royal family's name, Mahidol na Ayutthaya. These are officially bestowed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and it would need his approval for them to be revoked. However if, as expected, the crown prince divorces Princess Srirasmi, she will almost certainly lose both titles. The future status of her nine-year-old son by the prince, Dipangkorn, will depend on his father's wishes. Titles matter a great deal in status-obsessed Thailand, in particular when it comes to those with a claim to the throne. The 1924 Palace Succession Law, enshrined in subsequent constitutions, follows the principle of primogeniture, meaning Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn is the designated heir to King Bhumibol, and his own sons should inherit the throne after him, ranked by age. However, the law also gives reigning kings considerable sway in choosing their own successor - and an amendment to the constitution now allows the possibility of a female successor. The crown prince has four sons by his second marriage, whom he disowned in 1997 when he severed all ties with their mother, Yuvadhida Polpraserth. At the time the crown prince stated that they had renounced all their royal titles. But the palace continues to recognise their right to use the title HSH, or His Serene Highness, even though the boys, now grown up, are banished from Thailand and live in the United States. That leaves some doubt over where they sit in line to the throne, even though most commentators believe they are no longer considered possible successors. It is widely believed that the crown prince may have had another baby boy this year with his current mistress, who is likely to become his next wife. The issue is critical in a country where the monarchy is considered pivotal to political stability, and where King Bhumibol, who turns 87 this week, is in such frail health. Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn appears to be sorting out his personal affairs before the succession, so that he can choose who will be his queen, and who will eventually succeed him.","The scandal surrounding Princess Srirasmi, the wife of Thailand's Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, has gripped the country.","['The summary is incorrect because the source does not make mention of the Prince name ""Maha"".

"Raymond Dempster raped a 42-year-old woman in her home in Glasgow's east end and days later attacked a 19-year-old student in the city's west end. Dempster, who has 110 previous convictions, had denied the charges. At the High Court of Glasgow, Judge Norman Ritchie QC deferred sentence for background reports. The court heard how the 38-year-old raped the first victim in her home on 20 June, three days after his release from prison. The victim has since died, and her police statement was read out as evidence in court. She told how she was locked out of her home in her nightclothes. When Dempster came along at first she thought he was a Good Samaritan. She had said: ""He told me once we were inside 'you've got a nice wee flat here'."" He then grabbed her by the arms and pushed her into the bedroom, removing her clothing and raping her. The court heard that Dempster bit his victim and punched her on the face during her ordeal. Dempster's other victim was walking home alone along Kelvin Walkway in the early hours of the morning on 23 June. He followed her, then grabbed her, forced her to the ground and put his hand over her mouth. The woman fought back kicking Dempster in the face, and he ran off to the hostel he was living in. She said: "" I believe his intention was to rape me."" Police found CCTV footage which showed Dempster in the vicinity of the attack and his victim identified him. The prosecutor said that Dempster was jailed for five years in 2003 for rape and has breached the condition of the sex offenders' register five times. His 110 previous convictions also included dishonesty and violence. Judge Norman Ritchie QC said: ""A man with his record is simply shown the door and then within a handful of days has attacked two women.""

"In rational, post-Enlightenment Europe, religion has long since been relegated to a safe space, with Judaism and Christianity the safe targets of satire in secular western societies. Not so Islam. The battle within Islam itself between Sunni and Shia, so evident in the wars of the Middle East, and the fight between extremist interpretations of Islam such as those of Islamic State and Muslims who wish to practice their religion in peace, is now being played out on the streets of Europe with potentially devastating consequences for social cohesion. These latest shootings may be the work of ""lone wolves"" but their consequences will ripple across Europe and provoke much soul-searching about the failure of integration over the past decades. Immigrant communities are already being viewed with increasing suspicion in both France and Germany, with their significant Muslim populations, and even in the UK. France has the largest Muslim population in Europe, some five million or 7.5% of the population, compared with Germany's four million or 5% of the population, and the UK's three million, also 5% of the population. In all three, mainstream political parties are being forced to confront popular discontent over levels of immigration and the apparent desire of some younger, often disaffected children or grandchildren of immigrant families not to conform to western, liberal lifestyles - including traditions of religious tolerance and free speech. In the UK, that unease has largely played out on the public stage in a more peaceable manner, in the debate over ""British values"" and the recent Trojan horse schools affair. The fatwa against the writer Salman Rushdie over 20 years ago following the publication of The Satanic Verses, forcing him into hiding for several years, was perhaps the first time the issue impinged on British consciousness, though the attacks of 7/7 were a reminder that extremist violence could also hit the heart of the UK. However, France has already seen much more violence on its streets carried out in the name of religion over the past decades, although it has tried to write off most of its recent ""lone wolf"" attacks as the acts of mentally-unhinged individuals. But some in its Jewish community have responded to increasing anti-Semitism and the killing of Jews in France and Belgium by Islamist extremists by emigrating to Israel and elsewhere. Recent physical attacks on synagogues and Jews in the suburbs of Paris, where Jews and Muslims often live side by side in poorer areas such as Sarcelles, only exacerbated fears that the violence in the name of religion that grips parts of Africa and the Middle East, and which so many flee to Europe to escape, has followed them here. Germany, too, has seen a rising surge of anti-Islam sentiment in its cities, with worries about young radicalised Muslims moving from a concern confined to far right and neo-Nazi parties into the mainstream, as seen in the recent popularity of the Pegida movement, which campaigns against the ""Islamisation"" of Europe. Both political and religious leaders in Germany have spoken out against the movement, and counter-marches have been held, but Pegida's fears have brought thousands onto the streets. The killings at Charlie Hebdo are a deeply unwelcome reminder to the west that for some, mainly young radicalised men, their fundamentalist interpretation of their religion matters enough to kill those who offend it. As a result, across western Europe, liberally-minded societies are beginning to divide over how best to deal with radical Islamism and its impact on their countries, while governments agonise over the potential for a backlash against Muslims living in Europe. Today, mainstream Muslim organisations in the UK and France have unequivocally condemned the killings, saying that terrorism is an affront to Islam. But the potential backlash, including support for far right parties and groups, may well hurt ordinary Muslims more than anyone else, leaving the authorities and religious leaders in western Europe wondering how to confront violence in the name of religion without victimizing minorities or being accused of 'Islamophobia'.",The shootings at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris are the latest in a series of attacks carried out in the name of religion.,"['The summary states that Charlie Hebdo is a  satirical magazine, but this is not supported by the text', 'The summary states there were shootings in the offices of Charlie Hebdo, but the source text only mentions killings', 'The summary states that the shootings occurred ""in Paris,"" but the source text does not mention the geographical location of the shootings']","['The summary states that the shootings are the latest in a series of attacks, but the text does not confirm that these shootings are part of a series or the most recent attack.']",0

His widow Stephanie said she had believed in Hall's innocence. Read live updates on this story .

Meetings at Hollesley Bay Open Prison, where Hall was held before being transferred to Wayland after he took an overdose of his anti-smoking medication on 8 September 2013, he spoke openly about his issues and was under constant supervision. He was considered to be at high risk of suicide and self-harm. Jurors have heard that Hall was also a user of Spice, a substance smoked by some inmates that was recently made illegal under new legislation.

"Following a judicial review, Lord Jones said ministers reached their decision on SSE's Stronelairg project ""in breach of environmental obligations"". Landscape charity the John Muir Trust sought the review after the wind farm was given planning consent last year. The trust said the turbines would ""destroy the character"" of wild land. Stuart Brooks, the John Muir Trust's chief executive, said the charity was ""delighted"" with the review's result. The Mountaineering Council of Scotland and National Trust for Scotland have also welcomed the judicial review. SSE said it was ""disappointed"". The court heard that Scottish Natural Heritage had objected in principle to the wind farm's proposed site. Lord Jones said: ""If the ministers did take into consideration SNH's objection in principle to any wind farm development at Stronelairg, they have given no reason for rejecting it, and the decision is defective on that account."" The public was also denied an opportunity to comment on a revised planning application for the proposed wind farm, the judge said. He said the government's decision to give consent should be set aside. Energy Minister Fergus Ewing granted permission for SSE Renewables' project in July last year. It was said at that time the wind farm could generate enough electricity to power 114,000 homes. The operators also said it would bring Â£30m-worth of benefits to the region. However, the John Muir Trust said the development would ""destroy the character"" of an area of wild land in the Monadhliath Mountains. It lodged a petition to the Court of Session asking for a judicial review of his decision. SSE had sought permission for up to 83 turbines at Stronelairg near its Glendoe hydro electric scheme above Fort Augustus. However, in April 2013, Highland councillors voted 11 to three in favour of raising no objection on the understanding the project was reduced to 67 turbines. Following the judicial review, Mr Brooks said: ""This is great news for all those who love Scotland's wild land and wish to see it protected. ""A financial appeal brought a tremendous level of support from over a thousand well-wishers, allowing the trust to proceed. ""Lord Jones has now decided the trust's court action was well-founded.""

"In a speech he said that he expected rates to rise over the next three years, reaching ""about half as high as historical averages"", or about 2%. But he added that shocks to the economy could change the timing and the size of any rate rise. Interest rates have been at 0.5% for six years as the UK economy recovers from the financial crisis. The Monetary Policy Committee will ""have to feel its way as it goes,"" Mr Carney said in a speech at Lincoln Cathedral. He added: ""Short term interest rates have averaged around 4.5% since around the Bank's inception three centuries ago. ""It would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalisation begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages. ""In my view, the decision as to when to start such a process of adjustment will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year,"" he added. His comments come a day after unemployment rose for the first time in two years. ""That suggests the Bank's interpretation of those statistics is that unemployment falls are now being held back by skills shortages,"" said the BBC's economics editor Robert Peston. ""And those skills shortages are also responsible for rising wage inflation."" On Tuesday, outgoing MPC member David Miles, regarded as someone who is cautious about the impact of rise, surprised markets by saying it was ""likely to be right"" to hike rates soon. On Wednesday, Janet Yellen, the chair of the US's Federal Reserve indicated that interest rates are likely to rise in the US this year. That could be a few months earlier than in the UK if indeed the Bank of England were to move in the new year. If rates were to rise early in the new year, from the current all-time record low of 0.5%, that would be three or four months after the expected equivalent move by the US Federal Reserve. Now for those of you with big debts looking for reassurance that you are not going to be financially crippled by the increase, he has said two other things of note about the so-called Bank Rate. First typical interest rate changes, increments, will be typically much smaller than the half of a percentage point that they used to be before the Crash of 2008 - so probably one quarter of a percentage point, or even possibly an eighth. Also he has signalled that the new normal rate of interest over the medium term after a succession of rises over two or three years will be perhaps half the 4.5% over rate of the past 300 years. So nearer 2%.

"Mark Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, denies murdering Amelia Jones in Pontnewydd in November, 2012. His daughter Sarah Jones was asked by the defence barrister, Roger Thomas QC, about a trip to the doctors with Amelia on 7 November 2012. She admitted ""exaggerating"" about the doctor's diagnosis. Mr Thomas asked her what the diagnosis was and Ms Jones told the court: ""She had a cold"". The court was told that she had previously said, in a text message: ""They want to check her, and they might keep her in overnight"". Mr Thomas suggested those two accounts differed from each other. Sarah Jones replied ""Don't you over-exaggerate with stuff sometimes"". Mr Thomas asked, ""So you do exaggerate?"" Ms Jones then replied: ""Yes"". Ms Jones, 26, told Newport Crown Court on Tuesday she found Amelia in tears after leaving her in Mr Jones's care in a car during a shopping trip, days before her death. The defendant's barrister quizzed Ms Jones as to why she gave uncertain answers in a police interview about whether she actually went shopping on that day. She said from the stand: ""I had all my other children taken off me, I had been arrested for murder; I wasn't in the right frame of mind."" Ms Jones was later released and her children were returned to her, the court heard. But Mr Thomas said the incident relating to Amelia being upset in Mr Jones's care ""didn't happen at all like this"". He said ""Amelia was left alone in the house with Mark"", and not in a car, as she had suggested. The QC accused Ms Jones of ""not being entirely fair and truthful"" about her recollection, adding: ""The incident you have described yesterday did not occur"". ""It did occur"", she replied. Prosecuting counsel, Paul Lewis, asked Ms Jones if she had ""ever laid a finger on Amelia, so as to harm her"". She replied: ""No, not at all"". Ms Jones told the court she now has another child with Amelia's father, Ian Skillern, who was born in 2013. The pair are no longer in a relationship. During earlier evidence, Ms Jones claimed her father said Amelia had been ""a nightmare"" when he babysat the night before the baby received her fatal injuries.

"Glenn Houston, who was the only original panel member, cited personal reasons for his departure. He remained on the inquiry team last year after the resignation of the chairwoman, Susan O'Brien QC, and panel member Prof Michael Lamb. One survivors' group said it was ""indicative of a crisis"" in the inquiry which is examining allegations of child abuse in residential accommodation. Andi Lavery, spokesman for the survivors' group White Flowers Alba, said victims were rapidly losing confidence in the inquiry's credibility. And Alan Draper, from In Care Abuse Survivors, said survivors were ""at a loss"" to understand what was happening. He told BBC Scotland: ""There is concern that the inquiry is dominated by the legal profession, without any balance from other professional groups who have a detailed knowledge of child abuse and its impact and implications for survivors and their families. ""Survivors are considering withdrawing from this whole process until they are satisfied that survivors are placed at the centre of the inquiry. ""The inquiry is about what happened to them and the failure of the establishment to protect them from harm. This failure is continuing."" The probe is due to report in late 2019. Mr Houston said a ""change in priorities"" in his working life meant he had applied for positions at the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and the Disclosure and Barring Service. ""I have now been successful in those applications and the appointments have been made,"" he said. ""Lady Smith and I have discussed the potential that at some future time, a perception of conflict of interest may arise between these appointments and my work as a panel member on the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry. ""After careful consideration of both the time commitment required to fulfil these new roles and the potential, however small, for perceptions to arise of conflict of interest, I have tendered my resignation to the inquiry."" Mr Houston added that he had been ""honoured"" to be appointed to the panel. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he had accepted the resignation of Mr Houston and thanked him for his positive contribution. ""I know this was not an easy decision for him to reach, but he can be very proud of the contribution he has made to the establishment of the Child Abuse Inquiry and to ensuring its continuing progress,"" he said. In July 2016, senior judge Lady Smith was appointed as the new chairwoman of the inquiry following Ms O'Brien's resignation. A successor to Mr Houston will not be appointed to the inquiry so Lady Smith will continue as the sole panel member. The Scottish government said this brought it in line with other public inquiries established in Scotland under the 2005 Inquiries Act. The abuse inquiry has been plagued by problems since it was set up in October 2015. More than Â£3.5m has been spent on it during this period. Prof Lamb resigned in June 2016 claiming the inquiry was ""doomed"". Ms O'Brien stood down days later after being told she faced the sack over ""unacceptable"" comments about child sex abuse victims. The QC complained of government interference in the inquiry which she said had ""undermined"" her. But the Scottish government denied it was interfering with the inquiry and Lady Smith has also since insisted the investigation will be fully independent. Scottish Labour said Mr Swinney needed to reassure survivors the inquiry would not be delayed further and urged him to appoint more panel members. The party's education spokesman Iain Gray added: ""What is important is that the inquiry proceeds promptly so survivors can feel a sense of justice.""",A second member of the Scottish government's child abuse inquiry has resigned.,"[""The summary states that a second member of the inquiry has resigned, but the text indicates that multiple members (Susan O'Brien QC and Prof Michael Lamb) had already resigned before Glenn Houston, making him at least the third member to resign.""]",[],0
"Organisers campaigning to save Lewisham Hospital say the plans are ""crazy and ill thought out"". Under proposals, its A&E will close and the maternity unit be downgraded after neighbouring South London Healthcare NHS Trust ran up debts of Â£150m. The government said ""doing nothing is not an option"" and is to make a decision on 1 February. Campaigners are angry Lewisham Hospital, which is not part of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, is being targeted in a re-organisation of services across the area following the trusts's financial problems. Under the plans, the trust's Queen Elizabeth Hospital site in Woolwich would come together with Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust to create a new organisation. Lewisham's A&E unit would then be downgraded to an urgent care centre, meaning emergency cases would be seen at nearby hospitals. The maternity unit at Lewisham could also be slimmed down, meaning complex cases would be dealt with elsewhere. South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs three hospitals, was placed in administration last year when it started losing about Â£1.3m a week. The problems it faces are not unique. Last year it was reported 20 trusts had declared themselves financially unsustainable in their current form. Matthew Kershaw, a special administrator, said in a report to the government that the trust should be broken up, with other organisations taking over the management and delivery of services. If implemented fully, Mr Kershaw said his recommendations would result in a radical overhaul of services in south London, and help deliver ""safe, high-quality, affordable and sustainable services."" Mr Kershaw also recommended the Department of Health (DoH) write off any debts to ensure new organisations were not ""saddled with the issues of the past"". ""I have said consistently that the status quo is not an option, and I believe these final, refined recommendations are the right ones, although I appreciate that some people will find them difficult to accept,"" his report said. In November thousands of people marched in protest at the plans and BBC London reporter Matt Morris said at least 15,000 attended Saturday's event. The Save Lewisham Hospital group said 25,000 took part. Dr Louise Irvine, a local GP and chairman of the Save Lewisham Hospital campaign, said: ""This decision is crazy and ill thought out. ""It is a big mistake and carries huge clinical risks of things going wrong for patients but also political risk. ""If Jeremy Hunt can close a good local hospital here, he can do it anywhere in the country - nowhere is safe.""

CCTV showed the 31-year-old threatening staff with the axe before shopkeeper Sab Dhillon tackled him to the floor and restrained him. Durham Crown Court heard McKerry, of Coundon, near Bishop Auckland, had earlier admitted attempted robbery. McKerry, whose face was hidden by a scarf and hood, brandished the weapon as he ordered shop assistant Andrea Brighty to fill a bag with money from the till, the court heard. But Mr Dhillon ran from a back office, grabbed McKerry from behind and wrestled him to the floor. The court heard McKerry, dubbed Boomerang Boy because of his repeated spells in prison, had been arrested more than 80 times. He was told he must serve an extended four-year licence period after he is released. The court was told McKerry started shoplifting at the age of 12 and by 15 he had been arrested 80 times, and had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. McKerry once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. Dramatic CCTV footage from the shop showed the masked McKerry waving an axe as he demanded cash from terrified assistant Andrea Brighty. But he did not see Mr Dhillon's rugby tackle, which dropped him to the floor, sending shelves and produce tumbling. As the men wrestled, and with McKerry still holding the axe, Mr Dhillon's wife Sam helped, hitting him twice with a baseball bat to make him drop the weapon. Blood can be seen coming from the would-be robber's nose and Mr Dhillon gestured to his wife to drop the bat. Minutes later the police arrived and arrested McKerry, who, the court heard, had been arrested more than 80 times and had 64 previous convictions. Speaking to BBC Tees shortly after the raid, Mr Dhillon said: ""I was in the back storeroom on the computer and I heard Andrea, who was behind the counter shouting 'no, no, no'. ""I saw a guy waiving an axe at her. I came up behind him and pulled him away from Andrea and the counter. We struggled, fell on the floor. ""I managed to keep hold of him and get the axe off him and hold him there until the police arrived."" During his summing up in court, Judge Christopher Prince described Mr Dhillion's actions as a ""conspicuous display of bravery."" The court was told McKerry's history of offending also included burglary, assaulting a police officer, attempted robbery and criminal damage.",A would-be robber who was tackled to the ground by a shopkeeper armed with a rugby tackle and a baseball bat has been jailed for eight years.,"['The person who performed the rugby tackle is not the same person that was armed with the bat.', 'The period of eight years is not supported by the source text']",[],0
"National Grid applied to install the overhead line which would carry electricity from the proposed new nuclear power station, Hinkley C. The Planning Inspectorate has announced it will hold a six-month inquiry, during which local people can comment. It will then make a recommendation to the Secretary of State. Sir Michael Pitt, chief executive for the Planning Inspectorate, said the application ""met the required tests"" and the decision was made after ""careful consideration"". ""The applicant must now decide when to publicise the fact that its application has been accepted to proceed to examination and announce when members of the public will be able to register with the Planning Inspectorate as an interested party in the application,"" he added.

"Alfie Hyett was found by his mother Louise Hembrow at home in Hereford last March. Police told the inquest they found no evidence to support a claim he was copying a choking game that encouraged people to block their airways. A verdict of accidental death was recorded at Hereford Town Hall. More on this and other stories from Hereford and Worcester . When the inquest opened in June, Mark Bricknell, senior coroner for Herefordshire, heard Alfie died of vagal inhibition, which causes the heart to stop through the stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck. Before the inquest, Ms Hembrow told the BBC she believed her son had taken part in the game where the brain is starved of oxygen to create an adrenalin rush. However, Det Sgt Mark Jinks, from West Mercia Police, said there was no evidence he had researched the game or discussed it with friends. Mr Bricknell said he believed Alfie had tied the scarf around his neck out of childhood curiosity or experimentation without realising the potential consequences, and had not meant to take his own life.","A seven-year-old boy choked to death after tying a scarf around his neck, an inquest has heard.","['The summary says the boy was 7, this is not stated in the source.', 'The summary says the boy choked to death, but the source says there is no evidence of that claim.']",[],0
"But he hopes they will not create pressure to increase salaries in Wales. There is an agreement which limits the regions bidding for each other's players, however Scarlets faced competition when re-signing centre Scott Williams who was out of contract at the end of the season. ""You've got to be realistic because it is a free market,"" Short said. ""No agreement can constrain someone's ability to look for work, and regions will be ambitious and will have their own player requirements. ""How the financial fallout from that works is part of the regions' agreement, and one would hope that you wouldn't see pressure within Wales to increase salaries because we've got enough to deal with outside of Wales."" Wales international Williams had been expected to renew his national dual contract (NDC), funded 60% by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). However, the WRU withdrew their offer with union chairman Gareth Davies saying it was because the regions had ""upped the ante"". Williams ended up signing a conventional deal with the Scarlets. The NDCs were introduced as a mechanism to stop high-profile players leaving Wales for England and France. Short was chairman of the regions' representative body - now called Pro Rugby Wales - when they negotiated the deal which funds and governs domestic rugby in Wales. He said he would not have expected the union to get involved in a bidding war, and backed the dual contracts. ""The union have been excellent in supporting regions in the past year,"" he added.

"Ahead of the vote, here are seven things you need to know about the West African country - once hailed as a model of stability. The economy has boomed in recent years and Ivory Coast is the world's biggest exporter of cocoa, producing around 40% of the planet's beans used to manufacture chocolate. But this year, it also overtook India as the leading exporter of cashew nuts. Cocoa transformed Ivory Coast into the ""Paris of Africa"" as it was called in the 1970s and 1980s, until a slump in cocoa prices dampened the ""Ivorian miracle"". President Alassane Ouattara, who took office in May 2011, wanted to diversify the economy. Agriculture is still the backbone, but it includes bananas, rubber and palm oil too. The last elections in 2010 sparked five months of violence when former President Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down. More than 3,000 people were killed in some of the most brutal violence the country has ever seen. President Ouattara has been accused of one-sided justice after hundreds of Mr Gbagbo's supporters were imprisoned but very few from his side were even arrested - despite the UN and international human rights organisations saying both sides committed atrocities. No more ""nids de poules"" on the country's major roads. The French call potholes ""chicken nests"". The government says it has built 1,000km (620 miles) of new roads since it has been in power and rehabilitated another 20,000km throughout Ivory Coast. It is promising to build 1,200km more if re-elected. There were 10, now there are seven. A former finance minister, Mamadou Koulibaly, and former foreign minister, Amara Essy, dropped out saying the elections would not be free and fair. The latest, former prime minister Charles Konan Banny, pulled out on Friday, with the same complaint. That leaves another former prime minister - Pascal Affi N'Guessan, leader of Laurent Gbagbo's former party - as Mr Ouattara's main rival. Mr Ouattara is the eldest at 73, while independent candidate Claire Jacqueline Kouangoua, one of only two women running, is the youngest at 44. Mr Affi N'Guessan, the main opposition candidate, is using the same slogan that France's Francois Hollande did in his last campaign , ""Le changement maintenant"", meaning ""Change now"", which is ironic considering how unpopular Mr Hollande is now in France. Mr Ouattara, known to his supporters as ""Ado"" because of his initials, has chosen to use ""Avec Ado, reussir ensemble"", meaning ""With Ado, succeed together"". This is also interesting because one of the main criticisms of President Ouattara has been his lack of focus on reconciliation since the crisis. The campaign theme of ""togetherness"" is clearly supposed to address this. Music has always played a role in Ivory Coast politics. Alpha Blondy, the country's undisputed king of reggae, began singing about war and fighting in the country as early as 1998. In 2010, he openly backed former President Laurent Gbagbo, giving a free concert in Abidjan. His main reggae rival, Tiken Jah Fakoly who sang anti-Gbagbo songs, had to go into exile and has decided to stay in Mali. And this election is no different when it comes to music and the main candidates have their songs. Mr N'Guessan's talks about ""the fighters"" being ""tired"" and how they were all the ""victims of the political violence"" but Affi N'Guessan is their man. Mr Ouattara's focuses instead on what the government has done for the economy, singing: ""With Ado, Ivory Coast wins."" The Elephants are the pride of Ivory Coast, and while football is a game and has nothing to do with politics, we all know that's not true. Didier Drogba has been attributed with single-handedly putting an end to violence that was raging in the country in 2005 when he fell to his knees on national television and asked fighters to lay down their arms. A week later they did. This year Drogba, along with his former teammates and other international Ivorian sport stars, like sprinter Murielle Ahoure, have a new message for voters. ""Election c pas gnaga"". It means ""elections are not about violence"", in Nouchi, Ivorian street speak.",Ivory Coast goes to the polls on Sunday to elect a successor to President Alassane Ouattara.,"['The summary makes up that the election is just about finding a successor when the current president is also running', 'The summary states that elections are taking place on a Sunday, which is not supported by the document.']",[],0

"This one-street market town, sitting on the border of the Kavre and Sindhupalchok districts towards the border with Tibet, was packed full of Saturday shoppers when the quake hit. Now it is quiet. Birds sing, villagers try to move rubble with their hands and, overhead, the hum of high-flying aid helicopters punctuates the air. ""They are flying in the sky, but no-one has come up to now,"" says Prakash Bhandari, who works as a waiter in Kathmandu but returned to see if he could help his home village. ""We are suffering. What to do?"" he asks. Despite having one of the largest casualty figures from Saturday's earthquake, this area has received little or no aid. Villagers say they need tents and food, and that they are worried about disease. They dug up the bodies of the people they knew with their bare hands. But Saturday was a busy shopping day and they think that there are many more people under the rubble that they do not know. ""We will die if there's no help from the government and other organisations,"" says Dhan Bahadur Shresthra who used to run the local pharmacy and was helping patients when the quake struck. ""I worked as a medic in the army for 25 years so I know that if we don't have clean water or food to eat, then there could be an epidemic,"" he says. Further up the hill, villagers have taken matters into their own hands. In a hamlet that is now nothing more than mounds of red earth and wood, 22-year-old Anjali Majhi has hired an excavator to search for the body of her two-year-old daughter. Just before the quake hit, Ms Majhi had shouted at her daughter for bothering her and had sent her off to play with neighbours. Now she says she will not rest until she can give her a proper funeral. ""We've found all the adults who died here and we've given them the last rites. I hope I can do the same for my daughter, otherwise I'll never forgive myself,"" she says. But Ms Majhi is not sure whether she will find her child. The owner of the excavator did not charge her to hire it, but he did make her pay for the fuel. It is running out now and she cannot afford to buy another tank. A few hundred metres away, across terraces of corn, men who have shaved their heads in mourning carry two bodies, shrouded in white, down to the river for cremation. These were found earlier in the day after another group of villagers hired the excavator for a few hours. It is the only help this area has seen since the quake ripped their lives apart. Then, out of nowhere, a bus arrives carrying dozens of Nepali volunteers. They are followers of the self-styled guru Master Godangel who stands at the roadside in robes of white and garlands of flowers and promises to help with food and shelter. ""I feel really upset about this government, I feel really, really upset,"" he says. ""It's a corrupt government. I'm not blaming them, but the way that they work is really very traumatic, very sad. ""They've received billions of dollars in international aid, but they're not doing anything."" Back up the hill, the fuel tank of the excavator is almost empty so its driver finishes for the day. As the rain starts to fall, the only place that Ms Majhi can take shelter is with her animals. ""We still have hope,"" she says. ""Helicopters are flying overhead. We can't see who's in them but they can see us, so they might come and help.""","As the search continues for survivors of Saturday's earthquake in Nepal, the BBC's Geeta Pandey reports from Bhaktapur.","['The text does not mention Geeta Pandey or any BBC reporter reporting on the earthquake', 'The summary states the earthquake was in Naple, but the source text only states that the earthquake affected a town near Tibet', 'The summary states that the report is from Bhaktapur, but the source text does not mention Bhaktapur.

After rallying from 117-4 in a stand of 110 with Peter Trego, Abell made 104. Despite Trego's 94, Somerset missed a third batting point but did take two wickets as the Bears closed on 27-2. Having proved generally below par with the bat on a lovely early summer's day at Edgbaston, the visitors then came out firing with the ball in a lively seven-over session. First they had former Bears skipper Ian Westwood lbw to Lewis Gregory before nightwatchman Boyd Rankin was brilliantly caught off Craig Overton at leg gully by James Hildreth, who had earlier been the only other worthwhile Somerset contributor with 38. After Barker knocked back Marcus Trescothick's off stump and Chris Rogers was caught behind fourth ball inside the first hour, eight batsmen failed to reach 15. An attack which persevered to keep the pressure on all day, was boosted by Trott taking 2-26 in 10 overs. Warwickshire captain Ian Bell, who left the field in mid-afternoon with a hamstring twinge, is expected to be fine to bat on day two. Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott told BBC WM: . ""They've not got a huge score but it's a decent score on this wicket. There's a bit in it for the bowlers. We've got to fight to get on top. We're going to have to bat well. ""It's been a while since my last Championship wicket, so I was as surprised as everyone else in the crowd.

"A further 26 people were injured when the two-storey factory, under construction in the Sao Mateus neighbourhood, collapsed. Two of the 36 people who are believed to have been working in the building at the time are still unaccounted for. It is not yet clear what may have caused the collapse. According to city officials, the construction work did not have the necessary permits and two fines had been issued already in relation to the work carried out. Edilson Carlos dos Santos, a lawyer for the owner of the site, blamed the engineering company hired to work on the building for the collapse. Mr Santos said the company, Salvatta Engenharia, had been installing lift shafts and staircases at the time of the collapse on Tuesday. The engineering company denied the allegations, saying in a statement that it had not yet received the keys to the building ""because the works he [the owner of the site] had agreed to carry out had not been completed"".

"The dangers of allowing ungoverned space, where militant groups have launched attacks on neighbouring Israel, ought to have been obvious to anybody in Cairo, but it was only the killing of 16 of their border guards on Sunday that finally prompted action. The inhabitants of the Sinai Peninsula, notably some of its Bedouin tribes, are a heavily armed force that, it would seem, the military rulers of Egypt who had recently stood down were reluctant to challenge. Now, in one of those bitter paradoxes of power in the Middle East, it has fallen to Mohammed Morsi, the recently elected president from the Muslim Brotherhood to clamp down on militants who claim Islamic legitimacy for their attacks. It might be argued that Mr Morsi is the ideal man to take these wayward tribes in hand - since he has both a democratic mandate and some degree of backing from Egypt's religious establishment. There is also a good deal of cynicism in Cairo about the tribes' professed religious motivations, since they are also widely believed to be involved in smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people. Even so, Tuesday's raid on Touma, close to the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean Sea, may indicate the opening of a bloody new chapter for Sinai. The raid, in which helicopters fired missiles into the township, had an aspect of communal punishment about it, or reprisal for Sunday's loss of border guards. Inevitably there will be some who want revenge against the security forces. Since the armed bands on the peninsula are thought to possess hundreds of light weapons, as well as technicals (pick-up trucks mounting heavy machine guns), and multiple rocket launchers they have considerable ability to cause trouble. The bombing of several hotels in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2005 claimed 84 lives was blamed by security officials on elements within the same Bedouin tribes, claiming ties with al-Qaeda. It underlines the degree to which the country's Red Sea tourist industry is vulnerable to reprisals. More recently the Israelis have accused the same groups of several deadly attacks along their border with Egypt. These created great tension in an area that had been peaceful for decades, and prompted the Israelis to start building a barrier through the desert in an attempt to prevent more infiltration. Today the Israelis have reacted with satisfaction to the new security crackdown, and have given their agreement to military reinforcements going into Sinai (as it required under the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries that sought to de-militarise the peninsula). Mr Morsi meanwhile faces the accusation that has been used in the past against those who have taken similar measures, of acting as Israel's policeman. The shooting of so many Egyptian soldiers at the weekend has allowed the president to present this action as a response to a challenge to national authority rather than an attack on Israel. But the scope both for serious escalation in this violence and for political difficulties for the new president will make the Sinai Peninsula a key place to watch in coming months.",Egypt's decision to launch a military operation against militants in the Sinai Peninsula is a brave one.,"['the summary adds info not found in the source: the commentary about the decision being a ""brave one"".']",[],0

A misconduct hearing in Northamptonshire concluded Special Sgt Bedford had been guilty of misconduct but not gross misconduct. The officer, aged 26, did not attend the hearing. For more on this and other stories, visit BBC Local Live: Northamptonshire . Sgt Bedford had been called to a house in Daventry in July 2015. A 90-year-old man had refused to go to the police station after being arrested. The man, referred to at the hearing as JA, had been accused of threatening behaviour towards a neighbour and of pulling his wife - JMA - by the hair two weeks previously. The hearing heard Sgt Bedford had adopted a ""confrontational approach"". At one stage he had bodily moved JMA across the room and had then pushed her in to a chair. JMA had scratched his arm and he decided to arrest her. David Ring, a solicitor acting for the police force, said Sgt Bedford had acted unprofessionally by shouting at and ""roughly handling"" JMA. JA was eventually taken to Daventry Police Station. His wife was given bail. Sgt Bedford later showed video of the arrest to colleagues at Daventry Police Station. Mr Ring said the officer had ""behaved unprofessionally by laughing"" and his actions constituted ""a very complacent attitude to confidentiality.""

"A skeleton of a meat-eating Jurassic dinosaur, the theropod, was uncovered by spring storms at Lavernock beach, Vale of Glamorgan, in 2014. The dinosaur's missing foot was found at the beach by palaeontology student, Sam Davies, of Bridgend, at the beginning of this month. ""My first reaction was that I was very lucky,"" he said. The fossilised skeleton of the theropod - a distant cousin of the giant Tyrannosaurus rex - went on display at the National Museum Cardiff's main hall in June after it was found by fossil-hunting brothers Nick and Rob Hanigan. Mr Davies, who studies at the University of Portsmouth, visited Lavernock, near Penarth, after his tutor told him its cliffs were rich with fossils. He arrived only hours after a cliff fall had exposed the fossil and before it could be washed away by the tide. ""It was pure luck that I found it. It was just sitting on top of a slab of rock,"" he said. His tutor, Dr David Martill, confirmed the find was the missing foot of the recently discovered dinosaur, after the student emailed a picture. Dr Martill said: ""This was a chance-in-a-million find and highlights how important it is to encourage fossil hunting in this country."" He said the specimen would help chart the evolution of dinosaur feet. The foot has been donated to the Amgueddfa Cymru, which hopes to put it on display with the rest of the skeleton soon. Dr Caroline Buttler, head of palaeontology at the museum, said: ""The dinosaur found by Nick and Rob Hanigan is the first skeleton of a theropod found in Wales. ""Sam's find adds to its significance because we can learn more about the animal and how it is related to the dinosaurs that eventually evolved into birds.""","A dinosaur's missing foot has been found on a south Wales beach, two years after it was discovered.","['The summary indicates the foot was found on a south Wales beach.

"The Soyuz rocket carrying Fyodor Yurchikhin, Karen Nyberg and Luca Parmitano lifted away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 02:31 local time on Wednesday (20:31 GMT Tuesday). Russian Yurchikhin and American Nyberg have both been into space before. Italian Parmitano is a first-timer. They arrived at the orbiting platform five hours and 46 minutes later. Their Soyuz capsule was using a new flight profile that dramatically reduces the rendezvous time from the traditional two days. It is technically more difficult and requires some very precise orbital adjustments, but it is deemed to be easier on the crew because it means they do not have to spend so long inside their cramped vehicle. Leak and pressure checks were conducted following docking at the station, with a hatch opening at 04:14 GMT. The trio, whose designation is Expedition 36, were greeted with hugs and smiles by the three individuals already on the ISS - Russians Pavel Vinogradov and Alexander Misurkin, and American Chris Cassidy. The new crew members will be given a week of light duties in which to acclimatise to their weightless surroundings. Work will then begin in earnest. Luca Parmitano's participation in this expedition is particularly notable. At 36, he is the youngest person to get a long-duration (six months) stay on the station. He is also the first of the European Space Agency's (Esa) new intake of astronauts to get a flight assignment. Selected in 2009, the former fighter pilot has a packed schedule ahead of him. ISS crews are now completing about 70 hours a week of science, conducting experiments that exploit the unique microgravity environment on the platform. Parmitano has a package of specific European activities to work through, which cover fields as diverse as fluid physics and materials science. The Italian will see all of the vehicles now used to service the station come and go during his time in orbit, including possibly the new Cygnus freighter which is made in part in the Italian city of Turin. He is also scheduled to make two spacewalks to work on the exterior of the platform. ""I've dreamt of doing that. Being an astronaut is about walking in space. For me, they are one and the same thing,"" he told BBC News. One of the spacewalks will help prepare the ISS for the arrival of Russia's big science laboratory, which will grow the 420-tonne complex still further. The lab will come up with Europe's major robotic contribution to the platform - a large arm that is able to move around the station to conduct work wherever it is needed. Born in the Sicilian town of Paterno, Parmitano expects to bring a strong Italian flavour to his stay in orbit - literally. Italian chefs have prepared a range of special astronaut foods for him, including lasagne and risotto. These will be delivered to the ISS in the coming weeks on the European robotic freighter Albert Einstein. Fyodor Yurchikhin, Karen Nyberg and Luca Parmitano are due back on Earth on 10 November.

Initial testing will be carried out at Three Bridges depot, then on the Brighton line before the train carries the first passengers next spring. Thameslink said the new trains would transform the service for passengers. The Class 700 trains will each have 12 carriages, instead of eight on many of the existing Thameslink services. An extra 1,000 rush hour seats are promised between Brighton and London and 80% more peak seats across between Blackfriars and St Pancras in central London.

"It follows concerns changes proposed by the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) could undermine the ""scores on doors"" scheme in Wales. In November 2013, Wales became the first UK nation to require food outlets to display their inspection ratings. The FSA is considering allowing third party auditors to be brought in to make much more limited inspections of premises. Senior officers in Wales are concerned the changes are fuelled by a need for councils in England to make savings - something the FSA has denied - and believe they would undermine the improvements in Wales. Mark Elliott, from the Directors of Public Protection in Wales, said: ""We should in Wales really consider a Wales-specific solution now, to build on what we've done, and not mess up what we've already got."" The FSA said the proposed new system would give a better picture about a premises' standards every day - rather than just on the day they are inspected - by taking their own audits and systems into account. It has also been suggested food businesses should have to pay for a licence before they could open.

"Some 670 arts organisations will receive annual grants worth a total of £340m per year. Three quarters of those have had their funding frozen. Among the losers is the English National Opera which has a funding cut close to 30%. Here, some of the other winners and losers reflect on their positions. The news that Richmond's Orange Tree Theatre had lost all of its funding came on new artistic director Paul Miller's first official day in the job. The funding represents almost a quarter of the theatre's income. ""I think the big, national contradictory pressures that are on the Arts Council were just so great that something had to give - and on that occasion it was us,"" Mr Miller told the BBC. ""I think there is an element of rebalancing out of London. Perhaps there was a perception about the kind of work that the Orange Tree was doing that was not easy to shift. ""Once upon a time, the Orange Tree was a fledgling start-up company that had its first Arts Council funding. For new younger companies to get into the system, it means that existing organisations cannot simply take for granted that they will continue to be regularly funded."" He said talks with the Arts Council would continue while until he developed a new business model. ""There are still many ways in which we can continue to take wonderful theatre in our lovely space. We just have to find a financially different way of doing it."" Salford's The Lowry arts centre had a 22% funding drop to £800,000 per year. But it also received a £3m capital grant from the Arts Council and a £1 million private donation - the largest in its 14-year history. ""It's a mixed result for us but one that we're broadly pleased with,"" said chief executive Julia Fawcett. The Arts Council funding currently represents about 6% of The Lowry's total budget, and this will drop to about 4% from 2015. ""It means we'll have to recalibrate, refocus and work harder,"" said Ms Fawcett. She didn't see ""too many seismic shifts"" in the way funding had changed outside the capital. ""The shift out of London is so marginal it hardly bears attention. It does look as if London-based organisations have taken a cut but it's at the margins. ""There's been some degree of restoration for some of our significant touring companies - like Birmingham Royal Ballet and Opera North."" Unicorn Theatre, which specialises in arts for young people, had a 30% boost taking its annual grant to £1.3m from April. ""Children's theatre has come a long way since the Unicorn was founded in 1947 and it's a terrific milestone to be recognised in this funding round as being equally important to the cultural life of the nation as any of the country's leading theatres,"" said artist director Purni Morell. ""We're absolutely committed to making this vital public investment count, not just for the Unicorn but for the whole of children's theatre in the UK, as we embark on an ambitious programme of commissions, productions, tours and talent development.

That knocked share prices of smaller UK banks which are already traded. A bank analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia calculated that would knock A$425m off its valuation, and suggested that could push National Australia Bank (NAB) to sell off a larger stake in order to meet its target for raising capital. A spokesman for the NAB was reported by the Melbourne Herald Sun saying the move would have no impact on the parent bank's earnings. A spokesman in Glasgow for Clydesdale Bank, which includes the Yorkshire Bank brand, declined to comment. Clydesdale Bank is seen at the Melbourne headquarters and in the Australian media as a drag on NAB, having amassed a large portfolio of bad property loans, and the high costs of redress for mis-selling financial products. The new NAB chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, has made it a priority to split Clydesdale, handing up to 80% of it to NAB investors and selling the remainder on London and Australian exchanges. Earlier this week, senior staff at NAB in Melbourne set out the case for investing in the spun-off UK bank, to institutional investors in Australia. They portrayed it as one of the so-called challenger banks which is best placed to take on the British market's 'big five'.",Shares in Clydesdale Bank have fallen sharply after the UK government announced changes to bank tax.,"['The source text does not say that the UK government made the announcement.', ""The summary states that shares in Clydesdale Bank have fallen sharply, but the source text does not mention any change in Clydesdale Bank's share prices.""]",[],0

Dundalk boss Stephen Kenny rung the changes after Dundalk beat Maccabi 1-0 to become to the first Irish side to secure a group stage victory in European football. Derry hoped to take advantage of any tiredness and the visitors made an impressive start with Patterson's glancing header bringing out out an excellent save from Gabriel Sava. City were on top but Dundalk netted with their first meaningful attack on 21 minutes - Alan Keane jinked through on the right and his cross was met by Shiels with a diving header. Shiels, the son of Derry boss Kenny, suffered an elbow injury as he scored and he was forced off with former Candystripes midfielder Patrick McEleney his replacement. McEleney created the second goal in first-half added time, a dinked pass finding Kilduff and striker flicked the ball beyond keeper Gerard Doherty. The two players combined again five minutes after the restart with Kilduff, who netted the goal against Macabbi, seeing his header smash against the woodwork from a McEleney cross.

"The Department for Transport predicted a ""decline in network performance"" once one in four cars become driverless. However, should driverless vehicles make up between 50% and 75% of cars, DfT researchers say they will reduce congestion. The average time spent delayed on city roads at rush hour will fall by 12.4% when 25% of vehicles are driverless. The DfT said early models of the vehicles acted more cautiously and the result could be a ""potential decrease in effective capacity"" on motorways and A roads. But as more people adopted the technology and it became common place on the country's road network, the study found that congestion could be cut by 40%. Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, said: ""There's a prize to be had in terms of swifter, safer journeys, but the transition to that world will be challenging. ""There are around 32 million conventional cars on the UK's roads - as driverless cars come in, traffic flow could initially get worse rather than better, potentially for many years. ""Much will depend on how an autonomous car's parameters are set and just how defensively these vehicles will be programmed to drive."" The study used software to map out the effects of the cars on the road network. The DfT said the report was the first step into more trials and researching, ensuring driverless cares are ""safe and beneficial for all"". Transport minister John Hayes said: ""This exciting and extensive study shows that driverless cars could vastly improve the flow of traffic in our towns and cities, offering huge benefits to motorists including reduced delays and more reliable journey times."" Ministers are also planning to extend existing insurance cover to driverless vehicles, covering individuals when they are driving and when they have handed over control to the computer. In the event of a crash caused by the technology, a government consultation document suggests the driver and anyone else affected should be able to claim from the insurer and, in turn, the insurer would be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer. In the document, the government adds it will incorporate the insurance proposals for automated vehicles forward into the Modern Transport Bill, which is expected to be debated by MPs later this year.","Driverless cars could cause traffic jams on motorways and A roads in the UK, a government study has found.",['The study is not defined as a government study in the source text'],[],0

"The Taliban have come close to the city in recent fighting, leaving it cut off and displacing tens of thousands. A BBC correspondent who has flown into Kunduz has heard gunfire and artillery exchanges not far from its centre. Afghan officials say foreign jihadists trained by the Islamic State (IS) group are fighting alongside the Taliban. Provincial governor Mohammed Omer Safi told the BBC that the bodies of 18 foreign fighters, including three Chechen women, had been found. Security forces and Taliban have been involved in a stand-off for about a week after the insurgents launched an offensive on Kunduz at the end of April. The insurgents are currently said to be massed in the Gul Tepa district on the southern outskirts of the city. This is the first positive confirmation by a senior government official that Islamic State is operating alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan. Until now, particularly in the south of the country, IS fighters have often clashed with the Taliban. But the governor said that the battle for the north is different, and here IS fighters are ""supporting the Taliban, training the Taliban, trying to build the capacity of the Taliban for a bigger fight"". And, he said, they were more violent because they wanted to die in battle as martyrs. As well as from Afghanistan's immediate northern neighbours, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, the dead came from Chechnya and Turkey. They were wearing black headbands marked with the same Islamic verses used by IS in Syria and Iraq. Battle heralds militant tie-up . Correspondents say the advance is the most serious threat to a provincial capital in years. Afghan army and police are involved in the fighting but there is no substantial help from foreign troops. The BBC's David Loyn in Kunduz says Afghan forces are thinly spread in this region, and as well as this determined assault on Kunduz the Taliban and their allies have also attacked remote outposts in the mountains of Badakhshan further east. Reports said at least 13 police were killed in the attacks. Governor Safi said the Afghan forces in Kunduz did not have enough air power and their helicopters lacked the armaments they should have. Only a few thousand Nato troops remain in the country, largely in training roles, after their combat mission ended in December. They have turned down several requests to assist with air strikes. People displaced by the fighting are spread across the city and rural areas of the province of Kunduz. The prolonged fighting could lead to a bigger problem if there is a failure to bring in the harvest this month, our correspondent says. Kunduz supplies half of Afghanistan's rice crop, so delays could have a far-reaching impact, he adds. International aid agencies are trying to assist the displaced, with the World Food Programme preparing emergency kits of flour, pulses, cooking oil and high-energy biscuits for 500 families, spokesman Wahiddullah Amini told Reuters news agency.","Fierce fighting is continuing near the northern Afghan city of Kunduz, officials say.",['The summary makes up it being a northern city'],[],0
"Carla Lockhart made the comments at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, of which she is a member. Ms Lockhart also confirmed a DUP statement which said she had a relative in the non-domestic scheme. In December, Sinn Féin said PAC committee member Michelle Gildernew MLA had a brother in the domestic scheme. Mrs Gildernew was absent from the committee on Wednesday. The PAC has been running an investigation into the handling of the non-domestic RHI for several months. The green energy scheme was intended to increase the creation of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses were receiving more in subsidies than they were paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became majorly oversubscribed. The fallout from the scandal surrounding the scheme, which is approximately £490m over budget, resulted in the collapse of Stormont's institutions and the calling of snap elections on 2 March. Mrs Lockhart told the committee on Wednesday her brother-in-law had been a recipient of the heat subsidy since 2014, but she had been unaware of that fact until January 2017. She was responding to a request from UUP MLA and committee chair Robin Swann for any committee member with an interest in the scheme to declare it.

Campaigners have warned the Department of Health that delays are putting children's lives at risk. Scotland's health secretary, Shona Robison, said the vaccine would be introduced to the immunisation programme for all infants in Scotland ""as quickly as possible"" following the deal - which was also made on behalf of the devolved government. Mr Hunt said he was ""delighted"" to have secured an agreement with GSK - the company that now manufactures the vaccine. It follows lengthy negotiations with another supplier - Novartis - which used to own the vaccine, called Bexsero. GSK acquired the vaccine from Novartis, which resulted in the price of the vaccine being reduced and the deal being struck, Mr Hunt said. Announcing the agreement, he said: ""I think that this is something families across the country - particularly ones with young children - will particularly welcome.""

"Langham Dome in north Norfolk, one of only six remaining training domes in the country, was built in 1942 and sits on the edge of a former RAF base. Film of enemy planes was projected onto its walls for target practise. A museum in the restored concrete structure is now open to visitors following grants from English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1986, plans to restore the dome at the former RAF Langham, seen at the forefront of both defence and attack during WW2, began more than 20 years go. The restoration of the 25ft (7.6m) tall and 40ft (12m) wide dome got under way in 2013 after the project secured grants of nearly Â£650,000.

"The unicorn is the official national animal of Scotland and continues to feature on Royal Coat of Arms today. For Sunday, willow artist Woody Fox has created a 2.1m (7ft) unicorn sculpture for the Crawick Multiverse art project in Dumfries and Galloway. VisitScotland is also encouraging people to ""spot"" unicorns elsewhere in Scotland. Carvings and sculptures of unicorns can be found on historic buildings, such as the National War Museum at Edinburgh Castle. A tapestry called, Mystic Hunt of the Unicorn, hangs in Stirling Castle and a unicorn is a feature of a fountain in the courtyard at Linlithgow Palace. On the Black Isle in the Highlands, The Stables in Cromarty has a large unicorn sculpture. The unicorn has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th Century when it was used on an early form of the Scottish coat of arms by William I. Reasons for the appearance of a unicorn include a theory that narwhal, a whale with long tusks protruding from their heads, were seen in Scottish waters after straying from their usual range in the Arctic. Unicorns were also written about by the ancient Celts, Persians, Romans and Greeks, and were often described as an elegant white horse-like creature with a single horn capable of magical properties. Wales and England are among other nations that also celebrate fabled beasts. The Welsh flag features a red dragon connected to one of the country's legends, while England's patron saint St George is said to have killed a dragon. Artist Fox's other artwork has also involved animals, but of varieties that can be found running around the Scottish countryside. He said: ""I was thrilled to be asked to create this unique sculpture of a unicorn to mark National Unicorn Day. ""My previous work includes deer, badgers, foxes and rabbits which bring homes, gardens, parks and public spaces to life. ""It has been very inspiring for me to work on this noble and spiritual animal for the first time and to help promote Scotland at the same time.""",A sculpture of a unicorn has been unveiled to mark National Unicorn Day.,"[""The source text doesn't say the sculpture is being unveiled, only that it was created.""]",[],0
"The 23-year-old has been linked with a move away from the Rec after his father Mike was sacked as head coach last May.

""If we get an opportunity we will,"" Diamond told BBC Sport. ""He's still in contract with Bath so we don't know where that is up to."" Asked if their current 10th-placed position in the Premiership could affect any offer to Oldham-born Ford, Diamond responded: ""No, as people come for money and ambition, and if you've got the money then you've got the ambition - Wasps are a good example."" Sale signed USA international AJ MacGinty and Dan Mugford from Nottingham this season after Danny Cipriani moved to Wasps and George's older brother Joe left for Yorkshire Carnegie.

Solomona was under contract with the Super League outfit until 2018 but left them to sign a three-year deal at Sale. Cas have launched legal action against the Sharks, Solomona and his agent Andy Clark. ""They openly said we'd made them an offer which was substantially more than what Warrington Wolves had offered them and they rejected that,"" added Diamond.

"Seamus James Laverty, 58, of Deer Park Road in Toome, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of fraud by false representation at Antrim Crown Court. Laverty sold ordinary glass as fire safety glass between 2010 and 2013 when he worked on the factory floor of Glassworks Ireland. The fraud totalled £145,000. The glass was sold to the construction industry and later used in buildings across Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and England. These include the Ulster Hospital, Strathearn School in east Belfast, Lisburn Road Methodist Church in Belfast, Magherafelt High School in County Londonderry, Carrickfergus Primary School in County Antrim, Tallaght Hospital in Dubin and Manchester University. A whistleblower, who was a competitor of Laverty, became suspicious of his company's cheap tenders and acquired a sample of fire safety glass from Glassworks Ireland. He discovered it was, in fact, ordinary laminate glass which had been stamped as fire resistant. The whistleblower alerted police and an investigation began. The court heard that Laverty had his own glass business but had gone bankrupt, so the company was taken over by his son under a new name. He was an employee of his son's business when the fraud occurred. A judge described the case as ""chilling"". Referring to potential harm to members of the public in a fire, he said: ""By the grace of God it was avoided but that's no thanks to you."" The judge added that because of the extreme financial pressures Laverty had been under and mental difficulties he had experienced because of those, he was prepared to ""temper justice with mercy"".

"It comes less than two weeks after former presenter Gretchen Carlson sued Mr Ailes for sexual harassment and wrongful termination, claims he denies. The New York Times, citing a source, said Mr Ailes and parent company 21st Century Fox were in the advanced stages of talks on his departure. The company would only say Mr Ailes was at work and a review was ongoing. A report in New York magazine, citing anonymous sources, says lawyers for 21st Century Fox have given Mr Ailes a deadline of 1 August to resign or face being fired. The lawsuit filed by Ms Carlson claims she was fired after refusing his sexual advances. She worked for the conservative-leaning US network for 11 years before her contract expired in June. Mr Ailes strongly denies the allegations and says Ms Carlson filed the suit in retaliation for not having her contract renewed. ""This defamatory lawsuit is not only offensive, it is wholly without merit and will be defended vigorously,"" he said. Further allegations have since surfaced in US media that Mr Ailes sexually harassed another Fox News presenter, Megyn Kelly. According to New York magazine, Ms Kelly has told investigators that Mr Ailes made unwanted advances towards her about 10 years ago when she was a correspondent.

"At least 19 people are known to taken their lives in 2008 and 2009 as the company cut thousands of jobs. Judicial sources say the company and ex-boss Didier Lombard are suspected of using a policy of unsettling staff to speed up job losses. France Telecom became Orange in 2013. It will now be up to an examining judge to decide whether or not to order a trial. But if it goes ahead it would be the first trial in France for bullying (moral harassment) of such a large company. As well as the former CEO, other figures could also face trial including his right-hand man Louis-Pierre Wenes, human resources head Olivier Barberot and four other directors. In 2006, Mr Lombard announced plans to cut 22,000 jobs and move another 14,000 workers, as France Telecom pushed for greater efficiency in the wake of privatisation two years earlier. According to an internal document cited by French media, he told a high-level meeting that he would ""do it one way or another, through the window or through the door"". In submissions made late last month, the Paris prosecutor accuses France Telecom of enacting a policy in 2007 that resulted in unsettling workers and creating a ""professional climate that provoked anxiety"" at the time of a ""delicate restructuring"" of the company, a judicial source told AFP news agency. The true number of suicides involving staff is unclear, but 60 people are thought to have taken their lives over a three-year period, and unions say as many as 35 died in 2008 and 2009. Officials speak of 19 deaths during the two years, 12 attempted suicides and eight other cases involving depression or related illnesses. Although the suicide rate at France Telecom was similar to the national average, many of those who died left notes blaming pressure from management. Mr Lombard accepted the restructuring upset employees but he has rejected the idea that it led to people taking their own lives. France Telecom, and later Orange, has been beset by tragedy since 2007: . The spate of work-related deaths was not confined to France Telecom. In 2007, car-maker Renault was investigated after three workers took their own lives.

Newspapers and websites feel such incidents are dangerous for India's federal structure. Such behaviour ""is hardly reassuring for any leader who plans to share the stage with his PM"", says an article on the First Post website. The article says that ""at first blush, this may seem like a minor spat driven by political egoâ€¦ but it underlines a certain Jekyll and Hyde quality that Mr Modi's leadership has acquired..."" ""It's just bad precedent that will, in the end, undermine Mr Modi's own credibility when he talks of working with the opposition - or when he visits an opposition-ruled state and can't find a single chief minister who will share a stage with him,"" it adds. Following the incidents, several Congress leaders have declared that they will no longer share stage with Mr Modi. The Tribune says such anger is ""manufactured"" and is ""directed only at the rival party's chief ministers"". ""The BJP is well aware that any protest in the presence of the PM would get wide publicity and thus serve the party's political strategy of creating an anti-Congress wave [in the upcoming state elections],"" it says. However, the Congress party's decision to not attend any official events with Mr Modi has also attracted criticism in the media. ""The Congress really appears to be losing the plot.

"The big difference is that the numbers from which you make your six selections will go up in October from one to 49 to one to 59. While this doesn't sound like it will make a huge difference, it actually takes your odds of winning the jackpot from one in 14 million to one in 45 million. Camelot, which runs the lottery, says that the new system will create bigger, rolling jackpots, which is true. Because it is so much less likely that anybody will win the top prize, there will be many more rollovers. It also says that the chances of winning a prize have increased, which is true, because people who match two numbers will get a free go on the game the following week. The chances of winning a cash prize, however, have fallen considerably. There will also be a raffle that will give prizes of £1m and £20,000, for which the odds of winning depend on the number of entries, but the organisers estimate that you have a one in 10 million chance of winning either £1m on the raffle or the jackpot. This change comes only two years after the last set of changes, which doubled the price of a ticket to £2 but introduced the raffle with £20,000 prizes. At the time, the prize for matching three balls increased from £10 to £25. The odds of matching three balls were unchanged, but of course the cost of entry had doubled, which effectively doubled the odds (because £2 would previously have bought two tickets). The estimated prize for matching five balls plus the bonus ball fell from £100,000 to £50,000 while the prize for matching five balls went from £1,500 to £1,000. It appears that the Lotto organisers have discovered that what persuades people to buy lottery tickets is rollovers to create enormous prizes. Camelot's commentary in its financial reporting about the effect that Euromillions rollovers (or the lack of them) have on ticket sales is very clear about that. The company is clearly counting on the lengthening odds of winning both vast amounts of money and small and middling sums having less effect.

"The so-called Valley fire is thought to be one of the worst in the state's history, and is still only 30% contained, spanning three counties. One disabled woman has died and four firefighters have been injured, while 23,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. Two dozen fires are raging in Oregon, California and Washington state. But the most destruction is in California, where mandatory evacuation orders have been lifted in some areas so residents can return to survey the devastation. Firefighters are scrambling to protect not only homes but the state's famed giant Sequoia trees, as the largest of a dozen fires edges ever closer to one of the national parks in which they grow. While the Valley fire has been the most destructive, covering an area twice the size of San Francisco, a second known as the Butte fire, outside Sacramento, has claimed 166 homes. Firefighters say it is covering 71,780 acres (29,048 hectares) and is now 40% contained. Officials say fire teams have been helped by cooler weather and higher humidity, although the forecast is for higher temperatures to return at the weekend . In California, the sound of summer is the crackle of flames. No one here in Lake County can remember anything like the Valley Fire. Firefighters say it has already consumed an area twice the size of San Francisco. And still it burns, leaving behind a landscape drained of colour, silent and lifeless. Ranches which stood here for more than a century were wiped out in seconds. And in the little communities of Cobb, Middletown and Hidden Valley, entire streets have been destroyed. For mile after mile the ashes are still smouldering. Most people have not yet been allowed to return to inspect the damage but when they do many will find that there is nothing to salvage. Cooler weather with some moisture in the air is helping but it will take more than that to stop the blaze. The fires burns and burns and California is counting the cost. In northern California, people who have been evacuated from their homes or lost their homes completely are gathered at emergency centres and high schools. Andy Elliott, a British firefighter working to battle the Valley fire, said it is one of the most extreme in California for a long time. Firefighters are calling it a ""career fire"", such is its speed and force, he said. ""The fire behaviour is unprecedented."" Mr Elliot said he knew the four injured firefighters and had breakfast with them just before they were hurt. ""It's a very extreme incident... very sad."" California is used to battling raging wildfires. But after a four-year drought, the state is suffering more than usual - 5,255 fires have scorched 217,827 acres of land so far this year, compared with 3,638 fires burning 90,894 acres during the same period last year. Northern California is currently bearing the brunt of the blazes, with 13,000 firefighters working 24-hour shifts to try to contain more than a dozen fires sweeping across parched hillsides in Butte, Lake, Napa and Sonoma counties. But Calfire's Lynnette Round says more wildfires could start anywhere in the state at any given moment. ""The terrain is so dried up that even if it rains a little, trees and brush are so dry, they could ignite at any time,"" she says. Southern California typically experiences its worst wildfires in October and November, when ferocious Santa Ana winds - which blow from the desert to the coast - can reach up to 80mph and whip blazes across swathes of arid land. The state's largest wildfire in recent years was in San Diego county in 2003. That burned 273,246 acres, 2,820 buildings and led to 15 deaths. California's deadliest wildfire on record was also in southern California, according to Calfire. Twenty-nine people died in Los Angeles county in 1933.

"Prof Yves Barde, from Switzerland, is renowned for his research into the way proteins in the brain work and their role in illnesses such as depression. Prof Barde, currently at the University of Basel, will take up his post at Cardiff University in September. It said science was an international business and ""we're importing one of the most important stars."" He was appointed under the Welsh government's five-year Ser Cymru (Stars of Wales) project to expand universities' research capabilities in the fields of life sciences, advanced engineering, and low carbon energy and the environment. Prof Barde received international acclaim in 1989 with the discovery of a gene which creates a protein - brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - which is involved in number of brain processes including memory. He has explored the the role of BDNF plays in healthy brain function along with dysfunction. Recently his team at the University of Basel focused on how some drugs can increase BDNF levels in specific areas of the brain. The research helped in the development of new drugs, including the first oral treatment of multiple sclerosis. Prof Barde says he hopes to develop his current research interests of using stem cells to understand how the brain works and also to explore mental health illnesses such as depression. He said: ""Some of the work I'll be undertaking in Cardiff will be about understanding the meaning of the link between the nervous system and neurological diseases which currently remains pretty mysterious, particularly in the case of depression. ""But alongside several outstanding research groups at Cardiff University, I will also aim to advance research using embryonic stem cells and reprogrammed somatic cells to advance understanding of neuronal dysfunction. ""This is a really exciting time for me, and for advances in neurobiology and for science in Wales."" Cardiff University is already widely recognised for research into stem cells. The university's chancellor and Nobel Prize winner, Sir Martin Evans, was the first scientist to identify embryonic stem cells. These are cells which are taken from an embryo and which can develop into many other types of cells that can then be adapted for a wide variety of medical purposes. There is some opposition to this research on moral or ethical grounds although the research has proved to be highly valuable in understanding many diseases. Cardiff University vice-chancellor Prof Colin Riordan believes the appointment will build on the university's strengths. ""It is a testament to the university's existing strengths in neuroscience and stem cell research that we are able to attract a scientist of Prof Barde's calibre. ""By working with others in his field, Prof Barde will be able to help Cardiff University tackle some of the biggest health challenges of our time."" Prof Ole Petersen, director of the university's school of biosciences, told BBC Wales: ""I'm delighted about this great prospect of fostering world-beating research. ""Science is an international business. We see throughout Europe that countries with the most internationalised science do the best science. ""And we're importing one of the most important stars."" Economy and Science Minister Edwina Hart said: ""A strong science research capability is vital to improving our economic well-being and securing a prosperous, healthy and sustainable future for Wales.

"Jim Murphy was responding to former Tory chairman Lord Baker's view that there could be a deal between the two rival parties after May's election. However, the Labour MP has not ruled out some kind of deal with the SNP. Mr Murphy told BBC political editor Brian Taylor that it was ""disrespectful"" to discuss political deals before the general election. On the suggestion of his party entering into a Conservative arrangement in the event of a hung parliament, Mr Murphy was very clear. He said: ""We don't need lessons from Tory dinosaurs about how to run Scotland, what a ludicrous idea."" Mr Murphy added that the differences between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party were bigger than ""I have seen for a number of years"". Writing in The Independent, Lord Baker of Dorking said a Labour minority government reliant on the SNP would be a ""nightmare"" situation at Westminster. He added that such an arrangement could ""stretch the constitution of our country to breaking point"". However, the SNP said it was trusted more than Labour to keep the Tories out. Asked if a deal with the nationalists was possible, Mr Murphy said he did not want to get into a ""post-match analysis on an event that has not yet taken place"". He told Brian Taylor during a half-hour webcast: ""As I say, if the SNP want to vote for our policies in the House of Commons, it's up to them - some time they have done that in recent times, quite often they have sided with the Tories against Labour."" Mr Murphy said he had no desire to focus on the ""politics of pessimism"" because he wanted his party to win government. The debate over coalition deals has arisen because polling suggests neither Labour nor the Conservatives would gain an overall majority in this year's election. If that is the case a coalition deal with smaller parties could be possible or a so-called ""confidence and supply"" arrangement could be agreed whereby the smaller party supports the larger party in key votes. During the webchat Mr Murphy was also asked about tuition fees, the Scottish independence referendum and his decision to fight his East Renfrewshire seat in May.","The Scottish Labour leader has dismissed the idea of his party entering into a coalition with the Conservatives as a ""ludicrous idea"".","[""The summary makes up his party's name""]","['The summary states that the Scottish Labour leader dismissed the idea of a coalition with the Conservatives, but the source text does not specifically mention a coalition; it refers to a ""Conservative arrangement"" and does not clarify the exact nature of the arrangement.']",0

A video of her with stitches on her head and stumps where her hands once were, wrapped in bandages, has also been shown by Kenyan media.

"Speaking at the Cannes Film Festival, she also said she had never personally experienced sexism in the industry. There are 12 films by female directors being shown at Cannes, up three from last year. In 2012, there had been none. Huppert told the BBC: ""I think the message has been clearly heard. But on the other hand, you don't want to bring women just to bring women."" The French actress, nominated for an Oscar for her role in controversial drama Elle earlier this year, continued: ""You have to strike the right balance between awareness and the reality of the situation... ""A good film is a good film. But we have to create the best possible conditions so there are more female films."" Asked why the issue of equality was still an issue in 2017, she said: ""A lot has been done already, but there's still so much to do. ""And maybe not only in [the UK and France] but in poor countries, where most of the time women pay a strong price for difficult economic conditions and political conditions. Women are the first victims - it's no secret."" Huppert was speaking after her talk at Cannes as part of the Women in Motion programme, which highlights women's contribution to the film industry. The actress said she had never been subject to sexist behaviour within the industry, saying she did ""everything possible"" to avoid those situations. ""I can figure it out from very, very far - I manage to never get close to it. I avoid it,"" she said. Huppert said she was glad the issue of equality was being talked about more. ""There's no reason why women, for the same work, should be paid less. And it's good that people talk about how difficult it is to make a film."" Huppert has two films showing at Cannes this year: Claire's Camera, which was filmed in Cannes, and Happy End, directed by Michael Haneke. Happy End, in competition for the Palme d'Or, is a family drama set in Calais amidst the refugee crisis. Huppert told the BBC: ""I just wanted to do a Michael Haneke film. I have a very privileged relationship with him as a director."" Asked if there was a dream role she would love to play, Huppert replied: ""I don't have dreams.

"The move was initially criticised by Colombia, which complained that it had not been consulted. But Colombian Defence Minister Luis Carlos Villegas has now published a review hailing the results. The number of murders in the border area has dropped by 10%, he said. More than 150,000 gallons of petrol and 400 cattle have been seized by Colombian forces since Venezuela's border security operation was launched on 19 August, added Mr Villegas. ""We have reached a new era of co-operation with Venezuela's defence minister,"" he said. The report was presented to President Juan Manuel Santos and his cabinet during a meeting in the border department of Arauca. Mr Villegas praised the results of the operation launched unilaterally by Venezuela, but said Colombia was already successfully tackling criminal activities in the area. ""I can affirm today that the border with Venezuela on the Colombian side is safer now than a year ago,"" he said. ""And I can undoubtedly affirm that the border is safer today than 60 days ago."" Venezuela surprised Colombia on 21 August when it deployed more than 1,000 troops and closed the main crossings along the 2,200km (1,400-mile) border. The move followed a shootout in which several Venezuelan soldiers were wounded by smugglers. Other troops were taken to the area in the following days to tackle crime and smuggling. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said that for many years Colombia had overlooked the problem, which was hurting the Venezuelan economy. Items subsidised by Venezuela's socialist government, including cheap petrol, are smuggled and sold at huge profit on the Colombian side of the border. Mr Santos recalled his ambassador to Caracas shortly after the operation was launched, complaining about the treatment of Colombians who lived illegally in Venezuela. More than 1,500 of them were expelled and thousands more fled in the following days.

"The opening session of the Scottish Parliament was largely devoted to ceremony, including swearing in MSPs and electing the presiding officer. Members found time to lodge 51 questions and motions - 28 of them from Willie Rennie on the China agreement. There was controversy about the issue during the election campaign. It emerged during the election period that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had signed the memorandum, potentially worth up to Â£10bn of investment, with SinoFortone and China Railway No 3 Engineering Group. At the time, Lib Dem leader Mr Rennie called for the agreement to be torn up after a parent firm of the engineering group had been blacklisted by Norway's state pension fund over fears of ""gross corruption"". Fears have also been voiced about human rights abuses. Ms Sturgeon said no firm investment plans had been made and insisted that due diligence would be carried out, although a UK advisor to the Chinese firms said specific projects had been discussed and claimed Ms Sturgeon wanted work to begin ""this year"". Mr Rennie lodged a total of 28 questions, all on the topic of the China agreement and government memoranda of understanding. He asked a series of questions about whether government officials were aware of the Norwegian blacklisting, their assessment of the firm's human rights record, what advice was taken before signing the memorandum, and whether the government would suspend the memorandum until it had investigated concerns. The Scottish Parliament website indicated that the questions were likely to be answered on 26 May. Ms Sturgeon has previously said that ""if there were any concerns that said these were deals we should not do, then we wouldn't do them"". A number of other MSPs also lodged questions on their first day back at work after the election. Labour MSP Neil Findlay submitted three motions, one of them on the ""growing number of Scottish citizens identified as being involved in undercover policing scandals"". His motion calls on the UK government to extend the Pitchford inquiry into undercover policing into Scotland, and says that if it does not, the Scottish government should set up an inquiry of its own. Mr Findlay also submitted a motion to welcome the verdict of the Hillsborough inquests, and another calling for directors of companies that take part in blacklisting to be tried in court. Green MSP Mark Ruskell, who has now returned to parliament having lost his seat in 2011, lodged 13 questions on his first day back in the job.

"More than two-thirds of those who took part in the poll opposed replacing the current method for electing MPs with the alternative vote (AV) system. Mr Clegg told the BBC the result was ""very clear"" and promised to ""move on"". The No to AV campaign said voters had safeguarded first-past-the-post ""for the next generation"". More than 19 million people took part in the referendum on whether to keep first-past-the-post, where voters put a cross next to their preferred candidate, with AV, which sees candidates ranked in order of preference. These preferences could have been used to decide the outcome in constituencies where no candidate wins more than 50% of votes cast. The Conservatives backed keeping the existing system, while Mr Clegg's Liberal Democrats urged change and Labour was split on the issue. Overall turnout for Thursday's referendum was 42%, with 6,152,607 voters backing the proposal and 13,013,123 rejecting it . Mr Clegg said: ""I wish I could say this is a photo finish but it isn't and the result is very clear. ""I'm a passionate supporter of electoral reform but we've got to accept this. If, in a democracy, you ask someone a question and get an overwhelming answer, you just have to move on."" He added: ""This is a bitter blow for all those people like me who believe in the need for political reform."" Prime Minister David Cameron said the referendum was always going to be a ""difficult moment"" for the Tory-Lib Dem coalition, but added that the result had been ""clear"". He added that the government would continue to deal with the problems facing the UK in a ""decisive"" way. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who supported a move to AV, said the public had ""delivered a clear verdict which I accept"". But he said elections still had to change in a way which made ""people feel more included in our politics"". The AV referendum campaign has been marked by strong words of criticism between the two camps. In a speech accepting his side's victory, No to AV campaign chairman Matthew Elliott said the result was ""clear signal from every part of the country that people want to keep our simple, fair and effective system for electing MPs"". He added: ""I personally believe this result will settle the debate about changing our electoral system for the next generation."" However, Katie Ghose, who ran the Yes to Fairer Votes campaign, which called for AV, said: ""The referendum hasn't been the debate on issues of democracy that people would have hoped for.

"The Ferrari driver was penalised 10 seconds for moving while in the braking zone while defending from Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo late in the race. The 29-year-old also had two penalty points added to his racing licence. Vettel had been promoted to third after Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen was penalised for cutting a corner. Four-time champion Vettel had indicated after the race that he realised there may be a problem with his defence against Ricciardo. ""I want to look at it again; he [Ricciardo] told me to. I am fighting hard and am supposed to give him just enough room,"" Vettel said. ""I know Daniel is sometimes optimistic going for a gap. I knew he would go for it whatever the cost. I tried to defend; we made contact. That is not ideal. That's why I want to look at it again. ""If there was something, I will talk to him. Before that, Max was brake-testing me into the first two corners. I was very upset with the fact Max held me up and didn't move and made me run into Daniel."" Ricciardo said before learning of the penalty: ""He doesn't deserve to be up there. I thought I had every right to be there but he kept closing the door under braking. I was frustrated with that."" The rule Vettel broke was only introduced specifically at last week's US Grand Prix. Media playback is not supported on this device . It was a rule clarification issued by race director Charlie Whiting on a specific issue that has caused controversy this year because many drivers felt Verstappen had transgressed their gentleman's agreement not to move under braking. Ironically, Vettel was one of the prime critics of Verstappen's driving. The new clarification states: ""Any change of direction under braking which results in another driver having to take evasive action will be considered abnormal and hence potentially dangerous to other drivers.

"Whitton Primary School, near Knighton, opened in a village barn in 1724, before re-opening as a school house in 1767. The closure is due to low numbers, and the cost per pupil being ""significantly above the county average"" Powys council said. Residents objected to the closure of the 15-pupil school.

"She had been widely tipped as the politician who would take over from the former deputy first minister, who retired partly due to illness. The 40-year-old County Tyrone woman is the current health minister having previously been agriculture minister. She paid a warm tribute to Mr McGuinness and said she was ""following in the footsteps of a political giant"". She said ""no-one can replace Martin"" but said she would continue the work he started. Mrs O'Neill will have just five weeks to prepare for an election after Stormont's power-sharing coalition fell apart over a botched energy scheme scandal. The fallout from the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal, which is approximately £490m over budget, led to Mr McGuinness' quitting after DUP leader Arlene Foster refused to stand aside as first minster while an investigation was carried out. As they hold a joint office, his resignation automatically put Mrs Foster out of her job and prompted the calling of snap elections on 2 March. Mrs O'Neill described her new role as ""the biggest honour and privilege of my life"". ""I have never been afraid of challenge and I have never been afraid to act,"" she added. She referred to her first act as health minister last year, when she ended Northern Ireland's blanket ban on gay men donating blood. Mr McGuinness said he was ""overjoyed"" at her appointment, which he said was part of a ""generational change"" within his party. He said that as health minister she had already taken on one of Stormont's toughest portfolios, adding that Sinn Féin did not appoint people to such ministerial posts unless they had the ""all-round ability to manage very difficult situations"". Tackling mounting hospital waiting lists has been a huge task for Mrs O'Neill since she was appointed health minister last May. In October, she launched a 10-year plan to transform the health service, saying it would improve a system that was at ""breaking point"". Opposition politicians questioned the lack of details in the plan, which was not costed. But it set out a range of priorities, including a new model of care involving a team of professionals based around GP surgeries. Mrs O'Neill was first elected to the assembly in Mid Ulster in 2007 and has held various senior positions within Sinn Féin. She has worked for the party since 1998, initially as political adviser to MP and former MLA Francie Molloy, before being elected to Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council in 2005. In 2011, she was appointed as minister for agriculture and rural development. The following year, she announced the department would move to a former British army barracks in Ballykelly, County Londonderry. After the announcement, it came to light that Strabane had been chosen as a more suitable location by an internal DARD assessment, a decision that Mrs O'Neill then overruled.

"The US company says the ""limited edition"" Toq is designed to showcase its new technologies rather than compete with its other products. Qualcomm is best known for making processors that power smartphones. However, one analyst suggested the device was too bulky to appeal beyond a niche enthusiast audience. The $349 (Â£215) gadget is being made available via only Qualcomm's website to US customers, and the company said it was ""unlikely"" it would sell the watch elsewhere. The Toq is designed to be paired with any smartphone running Android 4.0.3 or higher. It allows its owner to receive and send text messages, manage reminders and view other information - such as weather forecasts or stock prices - obtained via their handset. There is no software store for the watch itself, but existing handset apps can be adapted to send details to its display and activate a vibrate function. In addition it can be used to accept or reject calls, and control what music is being played from the linked phone's library. The company says that the watch's key innovation is its use of its proprietary Mirasol technology. Rob Chandok, president of Qualcomm Interactive Platforms, described this as being similar to the e-ink displays commonly used by e-book readers and another smartwatch - the Pebble - but better. ""In addition to the fact it offers colour, the refresh rate of Mirasol can be 30 frames a second, which allows you to build a touch interface,"" he told the BBC. ""That's tremendously important when you are trying to offer some of these experiences. ""In an e-ink display you can't refresh the screen fast enough to follow the finger."" Mirasol is significantly less power-hungry than the OLED tech used by Samsung's Galaxy Gear watch, meaning that unlike its rival, its screen does not have to turn itself off when angled away from the user's face to extend battery life. Sony's Smartwatch 2 does offer an always-on LCD display - however, it requires the user to switch on a backlight in dim conditions. Although Qualcomm suggests the Toq's lack of an on/off switch makes it the superior option, Mr Chandok acknowledged that the Toq display's graphics were not as vibrant or crisp as the alternatives. ""But we've got other versions of Mirasol in the pipeline that are going to have a better colour gamut and vibrancy,"" he added. Qualcomm has also included three other technologies it has developed that it hopes will attract the attention of manufacturers: . Mr Chandok said ""tens of thousands, but not hundreds of thousands"" of the watches were being produced, adding that its appeal was likely to be limited to an ""early adopter"" crowd. ""We would consider making more if the demand were high,"" he said. ""But our preference is for our partners to bring out products [using the new technologies] in the next six months, and we're working hard with a few people to do that."" He declined to name the companies involved, but did reveal that in theory the Toq could be made compatible with Apple's iPhones. ""We limited the spend on what we were doing and just built the applications on the Android side,"" he said. ""There's nothing keeping us from doing an iOS app, we just haven't invested in that."" Many analysts believe the market in smartwatches and other wearable technologies - such as Google's Glass eyewear - has the potential for huge growth. The research firm NextMarket Insights has predicted 373 million smartwatches will be shipped in 2020 compared with fewer than one million this year. However, one expert warned that Qualcomm and others had to make major improvements to achieve such numbers. ""They are still relatively bulky in watch terms and you still have issues with recharging, which is an alien concept to people with watches,"" said Chris Green, an analyst at the consultants Davies Murphy Group. ""The Toq offers a little bit more than some of the other smartwatches in terms of what it can do, but it's still ultimately a basic thing offering little more than a second screen, and is quite gimmicky. ""We've still to see anyone offer a smartwatch that delivers something that we actually need.""",Qualcomm has launched what it claims is the world's first Android-powered smartwatch.,"[""The summary claims the Toq is the world's first , but the text does not make this claim and mentions other."", 'The summary states the Toq is Android-powered, but the text specifies that the Toq is designed to pair with Android smartphones, not that it is powered by Android itself.

"IS ""fired at everything that moved"" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS ""caliphate"", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. ""According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months. Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.","Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, activists say.","['The summary makes up that Kobane is in Syria', 'The summary makes up the full name of IS']",[],0
"Morpeth beat Hereford FC 4-1 to become the seventh Northern League side to win the FA Vase in eight years. Hereford went ahead after 75 seconds through Rob Purdie's 25-yard shot, but Morpeth rallied to clinch victory. In the FA Trophy final, Scott McManus scored the only goal of the game as Halifax beat promoted Grimsby 1-0 in their first visit to the stadium. Grimsby Town were at Wembley for the second time in eight days, having won promotion back to the football league after a six-year absence with last weekend's victory over Forest Green in the National League promotion final. But it was Halifax Town, recently relegated to National League North and on their first trip to Wembley, who started the brighter with McManus sending a curling free-kick over the bar. Following a first half in which neither keeper was really tested, McManus scored the game's only goal in the 48th minute. The 26-year old sent the 10,000 Halifax Town fans wild when he lobbed Town keeper James McKeown from 25 yards. The Mariners upped their intensity, almost grabbing an equaliser in added time, but Halifax cleared off the line to hold on for a famous victory. In their first season in their new existence, following the demise of wound-up Hereford United in December 2014, Peter Beadle's reformed Bulls had already won three trophies this season - notably winning the Midland League at their first attempt. Hereford had three players on show - Purdie, Ryan Green and skipper Joel Edwards - who also used to play for the Bulls in their Hereford United days. After Purdie's explosive early opener, roared on by more than 20,000 travelling fans, the Bulls dominated the first half, hitting the bar and wasting a string of other first-half chances. But the game turned on 45-year-old Chris Swailes' leveller when he chested in after a goalkeeping error to become the oldest scorer in a Wembley final and it triggered the Highwaymen into action. Luke Carr scored from close range straight after the break, followed by further goals from Sean Taylor and Shaun Bell to earn Morpeth their first FA Vase triumph. That earned veteran former Ipswich, Bury and Rotherham defender Swailes his third winner's medal, having won the competition in 1993 with Bridlington Town and in 2012, with another north-east side, Dunston. And, in the end, they deservedly maintained the Northern League's recent stranglehold on this competition. which began with Whitley Bay's triumph in 2008-09. Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside: . ""We didn't get the icing on the cake, that's all I would say. Congratulations to Halifax, they played very well.""

"The academy said that nations were measuring their wealth by GDP (Gross Domestic Product), taking no account of the harm caused by business practises. It urged countries to act as stewards of God's creation. The statements are likely to influence the Pope's coming Encyclical on climate change. An Cambridge Economics professor, Partha Dasgupta, told the academy's climate conference in the Vatican: ""GDP is a disgraceful index because it does not count depreciation of our assets - including damage to Mother Nature, the most fundamental asset we have."" Cardinal Peter Turkson, who helped write the coming Encyclical - an official statement - said: ""For humans to degrade the integrity of the Earth by constant changes in its climate; by stripping its natural forests; to contaminate Earth's water, land and air with poisonous substances - all of these are sins. ""There is an all-embracing imperative to protect our garden, our hope. We must move away from our unthinking infatuation with GDP."" The academy heard speech after speech urging the moral case for protecting the climate for future generations. Meanwhile, a small group funded by a US climate contrarian body in Chicago has been in Rome rallying against the Vatican's climate drive. One of the participants, Christopher Monckton, said the Pope ""should listen to both sides of the scientific argument... not only people of one, narrow, poisonous political and scientific viewpoint"". Inside the conference itself, the astronomer Lord Rees, former President of the UK's Royal Society, was putting just such a balanced view. He acknowledged uncertainties over climate science, especially over how water vapour and clouds would react to warming. He said some people were willing to bet on a low level of warming, mitigated later in the century by new technologies more affordable in a richer economy. But, he said, the risks of triggering an irreversible catastrophe lasting thousands of years was too great. ""It would be shameful if our inheritance was a depleted and hazardous world,"" he said. The Church is hoping to make an impact in a year of key UN meetings on Sustainable Development Goals, development finance and climate. The Encyclical is expected to describe action to cut emissions as ""a moral and religious imperative, highlighting the intrinsic connection between respect for the environment and respect for people - especially the poor, children, and future generations"". The Pope is hoping to build agreement among all religions on the moral obligation to protect the environment. Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, who heads the Academy, said the Encyclical would not be the highest level of proclamation from the Pope, which is reserved for issues of Faith. But he said it was important for all the world's 1.2 billion Catholics to take it seriously. If any Catholic wanted to ignore it they would need ""very good reasons - based not on personal or political opinion, but on science"". For some Catholics, this may prove an unwelcome Papal intervention into a highly politicised subject. But the aid agency Cafod said its poll with YouGov showed the vast majority (70%) of Catholics say their community will heed the message of the Pope on climate change. Whether it will prove persuasive for American Republican lawmakers - around a third of whom are Catholic - is yet to be seen.

"Between the first quarter of 2016 and the same period this year, the amount of goods sold in Scotland rose by 0.2%, compared with British growth of 2.1%. Meanwhile, the value of shop sales north of the border grew by 1.8%, while Britain saw a rise of 4.8%. The figures were included in the latest Retail Sales Index for Scotland. Scotland outperformed Britain in the first three months of this year, however, in both value and volume terms. The first quarter saw the volume of sales in Scotland fall by 0.4%, while the figure for Britain showed a drop of 1.4%. And while the value of sales across Britain flat-lined, Scotland saw growth of 0.5% between January and March. Commenting on the figures, Scottish Retail Consortium director David Lonsdale said: ""The improvement in the headline figure for the total value of retail sales in the first quarter of this year is encouraging at first glance, but it looks less rosy once falling shop prices are taken into account. ""Indeed, shop prices have fallen each month for the past four years which demonstrates that retailers are having to work ever harder to maintain let alone grow sales values.""

"In a post on the social media site, he said his personal challenge this year would be to build a ""simple AI"" similar to the butler Jarvis from the film Iron Man. Mr Zuckerberg plans to share his progress over the course of the year. Last month, he made headlines for plans to give away 99% of his Facebook stake. He had to defend his philanthropic venture - launched to celebrate the birth of his daughter- after critics argued that it could provide a way for the founder to avoid paying tax on the sale of his shares. On Monday, Mr Zuckerberg said he would start to build the AI with technology that is already out there and teach it to understand his voice to control everything in his home from music and lights to temperature. ""This should be a fun intellectual challenge to code this for myself,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""I'll teach it to let friends in by looking at their faces when they ring the doorbell,"" he said.

"The varsity, which has educated more US presidents than any other, will take 50.8% of its freshmen from minority groups. That compares to 47.3% last year. Asian Americans make up 22.2%, followed by African Americans at 14.6%, Hispanic or Latino students at 11.6%, and Native American or Pacific Islanders at 2.5%. The milestone figures come just days after Harvard was drawn into a row over affirmative action between the US justice department and the New York Times. On 1 August, the paper claimed the justice department was preparing to sue campuses with affirmative action admissions policies, as it feels they are biased against white applicants. It said resources from the department's civil rights division would be used for the legal action, citing an internal memo. However, the justice department insisted it had no plans to investigate whether colleges pick their entrants based on race. It said the document seen by the paper, which referred to ""a new project on [...] intentional race-based discrimination"" was actually about a 2015 complaint by a coalition of Asian-American groups. The complaint accused Harvard and other Ivy League colleges of using quotas that keep out Asians with high test scores. Rachael Dane, a spokesperson for Harvard, said the university was ""committed to enrolling diverse classes of students"". ""To become leaders in our diverse society, students must have the ability to work with people from different backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives,"" she said. ""Harvard's admissions process considers each applicant as a whole person, and we review many factors, consistent with the legal standards established by the US Supreme Court."" The Supreme Court has outlawed the use of racial quotas in college admissions, but ruled that universities can consider race as part of a ""holistic review"" of applicants. Roger Clegg, president of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity and a former top official in the justice department's civil rights division, told the BBC he felt affirmative action was outdated. ""I understand the visceral sense that African Americans have been treated badly in this country for a very long time, and right after we got rid of Jim Crow [segregation laws], it wasn't such a bad idea to give special consideration over someone who was a recent beneficiary of Jim Crow. But now we're in 2017. Jim Crow is long gone and we're talking about giving Latinos a preference over Asian Americans. What possible sense does that make?"" he said. An alternative view comes from Brenda Shum, director of the Educational Opportunities Project at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. She told the BBC that students of all colours benefited from a more diverse college experience. ""...We owe it to our students to provide them with integrated learning environments that are reflective of the world in which they're living,"" she argued.",The proportion of minority students at Harvard University will hit a record high this year.,['The summary states that the number will be a record high but that is not stated in the source text.'],[],0

"TPG Capital and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan want to buy parts of Fairfax Media including its newspapers and property advertising arm, Domain. A deal could be worth as much as A$2.5bn (Â£1.4bn). However, loss-making Fairfax said the offer ""may not optimise shareholder value"". It also said the proposal may not get off the ground ""given the complexity involved in splitting the businesses"". A deal would also need approval from the federal government's Foreign Investment Review Board. Fairfax, which also publishes The Age and the Australian Financial Review, posted a loss of A$893m last year as it struggled with plunging print advertising revenue and newspaper sales. Last week journalists at the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in Melbourne went on strike for a week in protest after management announced more job cuts. However, the Domain division, which accounts for half of Fairfax's profits, is growing strongly and the company wants to spin it off and retain a majority stake. Domain is Australia's second-biggest real estate website after one owned by Rupert Murdoch and is valued by analysts at about A$2bn. According to Fairfax, the consortium has offered 95 cents a share for Domain, along with the metropolitan newspapers, an events business, and a start-up investing arm. That would leave existing Fairfax shareholders with assets including newspapers in regional Australia and New Zealand, as well as stakes in the Macquarie Radio Network and Stan, a video-streaming service. Shareholders would also be left with existing debt. Lee Mickelburough, of Henderson Global Investors, which owns about 5% of Fairfax shares, said: ""It's a troublesome structure to say that we get 95 cents for the good business and you get to keep the debt for the transition businesses.

"Mr Mortazavi, considered a close aide of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was taken to Tehran's Evin prison, the semi-official Fars agency reported. Until January, he was head of Iran's wealthy social welfare organisation but was removed under pressure from the Majlis - Iran's parliament. Mr Mortazavi, 45, was placed under US sanctions in 2010. He and other officials were accused by Washington of ""sustained and severe violations of human rights"". By Mohammad ManzarpourBBC Persian . Saeed Mortazavi's arrest could be considered a turning point in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's tenure as Iran's Supreme Leader. Having risen from obscurity as a young judge, Mr Mortazavi was instrumental in the mass culling of reformist newspapers during former President Mohammad Khatami's administration. He later gained further notoriety for his involvement in the case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photojournalist who died in custody following her arrest in 2003. More recently, Mr Mortazavi was accused in connection with the abuse and killing of post-election protesters in the Kahrizak detention centre. It is unlikely that Mr Mortazavi's arrest could have come without the supreme leader's approval. Whatever red-line Mr Mortazavi may have crossed to trigger this chain of events, his arrest marks the end of an era of impunity, long enjoyed by the Islamic state's most loyal enforcers. Analysts say his arrest could be the result of disputes between President Ahmadinejad on one hand and parliament and the judiciary on the other. The arrest was ""possibly"" in connection with allegations of torture and the deaths of prisoners after the controversial 2009 election, Fars reported. A few days after he was removed last month as head of the social welfare fund, he was rehired by President Ahmadinejad, but this time as official caretaker of the same organisation, angering some lawmakers. While defending the former prosecutor in parliament, Mr Ahmadinejad accused the head of parliament and the head of the judiciary of corruption, which analysts say might be one of the reasons behind Mr Mortazavi's arrest. Mr Ahmadinejad's controversial re-election in 2009 - and the violent suppression of subsequent opposition protests - has widened the rift between conservatives and reformists within Iran's political establishment. Correspondents say parliament has been hostile to Mr Ahmadinejad for most of his second four-year term which expires in August. Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani is a likely frontrunner in the race to succeed Mr Ahmadinejad.","Iran's former prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi has been arrested, state media report.","[""The summary makes up his role as Iran's former prosecutor"", 'The summary attributes the story to state media instead of Fars agency']",[],0

The pressure group said it meant, in some cases, the board risked breaking the law. The board said it was already working on measures to reduce risks. The findings of the annual safeguarding report were presented to officials at the health board last week. It outlined 13 'red' areas of risk, including: . The concerns by the NWHA come as the board meets on Thursday to get the latest update on two inquiries into events at Glan Clwyd Hospital's Tawel Fan ward, which closed in 2013. ""A year and a half after going into special measures and receiving additional support, we have to ask whether Betsi Cadwaladr is learning lessons and making improvements?"" stated Marc Jones, from the NWHA. ""These are not trivial issues but are serious risks. The scandal surrounding Tawel Fan should have been a wake-up call regarding the need to take at-risk patients' safety and well-being seriously. ""We do not want to see a repeat of that."" The health board's own analysis of its safeguarding weaknesses highlighted ""unclear"" policies, little evidence of sharing good practice, and relatively low uptake on safeguarding training. In an independent investigation in May 2015, relatives said patients on the Tawel Fan ward were treated like animals in a zoo. It led to the health board being put into special measures by the Welsh Government, and its former chief executive stepped down. Betsi Cadwaladr board members will be told later that the current inquires into what happened are expected to continue until the summer. Responding to the NWHA criticism, Dr Evan Moore, the board's executive medical director, said ""positive action"" was already under way and have continued since the safeguarding assessment was made in autumn 2016.

""I don't think it's about just skin colour. ""When you put a record on, it's about seeing things from a different perspective.

""His career has been so epic. He influenced me and so many other artists. There's no competition."" The best female category sees competition between Ellie Goulding, Lianne La Havas, Emeli Sande, NAO and Anohni - who formerly performed under the name Antony and the Johnsons.

"The events began a weekend of commemoration leading up to the anniversary on 31 May and 1 June. More than 6,000 Britons and 2,500 Germans died in the 36-hour Battle of Jutland, involving about 250 ships. Princess Anne joined First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for a service at a war graves cemetery in Rosyth. HMS Kent has weighed anchor at South Queensferry before heading to Orkney for further commemorations. Jutland, fought in the North Sea off the coast of Denmark, was the only major naval battle of the 1914-18 war. It brought together the two most powerful naval forces of the time and it became the largest sea battle in naval warfare history in terms of the numbers of battleships engaged. The events on Saturday were designed to mark the ""contribution and sacrifices"" made by those who served during the battle. The commemorations began with a wreath-laying service and then an act of remembrance at Rosyth Parish Church in the town where the battlecruiser force was based in 1916. A minute's silence took place following the ringing of a bell made from the hull of HMS Tiger, a battlecruiser which suffered light damage during the Jutland campaign. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The sacrifices made by those who fought in this battle, the largest naval encounter of the First World War, and by other seafarers throughout the conflict must never be forgotten."" A service of remembrance was held in South Queensferry Commonwealth War Graves Commission's cemetery, where 40 casualties from the battle are commemorated or buried. Descendents of those involved in the battle, local school pupils and children visiting from Wilhelmshaven in Germany were part of the event. Singer Barbara Dickson, whose uncle was killed in the Battle of the Somme, sang Scottish lament Flowers of the Forest as Princess Anne laid a wreath to remember lives lost. Elizabeth Dickson, whose father survived but her uncle, aged 16, was killed in the battle, said: ""It's very important to commemorate because, always, the tradition of commemoration and the rituals of commemoration are important because they're healing."" Admiral Lord West, a commander during the Falklands War who went on to be head of the Royal Navy for four years, said: ""We forget sometimes, these sailors didn't die in an instant. There were ones trapped below decks, terrible burns. War is horrible - it was a horrible death on both sides, and we must remember that."" In the final event of the day, hundreds of people lined the streets around Hawes Pier in South Queensferry. The band of HM Royal Marines (Scotland) performed the Beating Retreat and Ceremonial Sunset, while HMS Kent weighed anchor and fired a gun, before sailing alongside the MV Fingal, a strikingly coloured Dazzle Ship painted by artist Ciara Phillips.

"South Africa's instruction was that the money was for a Diaspora Legacy Programme which should be ""implemented directly"" by Mr Warner, Fifa said. The US says the $10m was a bribe in exchange for Mr Warner supporting South Africa's 2010 World Cup bid. Mr Warner and South African officials have denied any wrong doing. South Africa won the bid ahead of Morocco to become the first African country to host the World Cup. Africa news updates . Mr Warner hails from Trinidad and Tobago and was the president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) and vice-president of Fifa when the decision was made. He was among a string of Fifa officials arrested last week after the US and Switzerland launched separate investigations into corruption in Fifa, the world football governing body. In a statement, Fifa said South Africa's government approved a $10m project in 2007 to ""support the African Diaspora in Caribbean countries as part of the World Cup legacy"". The government, in agreement with the South African Football Association (Safa), asked Fifa to ""process the project's funding by withholding"" $10m from the Local Organising Committee (LOC) of the World Cup, the statement added. ""Fifa did not incur any costs as a result of South Africa's request because the funds belonged to the LOC. Both the LOC and Safa adhered to the necessary formalities for the budgetary amendment,"" it said. Martyn Ziegler, chief sports reporter for the Press Association, has tweeted a 2008 letter from Safa to Fifa secretary general Jerome Valcke, who has denied involvement in the scandal. The letter, written by then Safa president Molefi Oliphant, requests that the money should be sent to the Diaspora Legacy Programme to be ""administered and implemented directly by the president of Concacaf"". A Fifa spokesman told the BBC in response to the letter that the football governing body wanted to reiterate that Mr Valcke and other members of its senior management were not ""involved in the initiation, approval and implementation of the diaspora project"".

Sterling's first-half hat-trick was the first of his career, while Bony, who admitted he contracted malaria in pre-season, doubled his City goals tally since his £28m move from Swansea in January.

"Home Secretary Theresa May said Mr Bristow would lead an agency of ""powerful operational crime fighters"". The NCA becomes fully operational in 2013 when it takes over from the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Its expanded role will include powers to order police forces to run operations into drugs and trafficking. As well as replacing the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the new agency will take in the work of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), and also house the national cyber crime unit. It will also cover border policing and economic crime. ""For too long we have lacked a strong, collaborative national response in the fight for criminal justice. The NCA will make the UK a more hostile environment for serious and organised crime and strengthen our border,"" Mrs May said. She said Mr Bristow would play ""a vital role"" in developing the agency. Details of an extensive policing shake-up, which included the creation of the National Crime Agency, were unveiled last year by Mrs May in a Home Office consultation paper - Policing in the 21st Century. She described it as the ""most radical reform of policing for 50 years"". Mr Bristow said he would work with the government and other crime agencies ""to ensure that the NCA delivers the maximum protection possible for communities within the resources it has available"".

"LeRoy, 68, has replaced Tom Saintfiet, with Togo struggling in 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying and the country's domestic football in a poor state. He said: ""I know it will be difficult; we have only a small chance to qualify for the next Nations Cup and Togo also needs to work on local football. ""But I'm happy, I like this challenge."" The task appealed to LeRoy to the extent that he ended talks with Tunisia, Algeria and Nigeria over their vacant coaching positions and agreed a three-year contract with Togo after ""only a few hours' negotiation"" - but only after Saintfiet's departure had been confirmed. ""I told them I did not want to discuss the situation before they had an agreement with Saintfiet,"" LeRoy revealed. ""It is always a pity when a coach leaves his job."" Togo are third in their Nations Cup qualification group with two games to play and only the winners are guaranteed a place at next year's finals in Gabon. LeRoy feels the best Togo can hope for is to take one of the two places given to the best group runners-up - and the Frenchman knows he must convince talismanic striker Emmanuel Adebayor to commit to the cause. ""The key players help the team to get results and win big competitions. I like characters, I like difficult players and I have had a lot of them in my career - starting from Roger Milla (when LeRoy was coach of Cameroon). ""But these players I had were also the first ones at training and the last to leave. They worked hard and were at the disposal of the team. ""Emmanuel has the potential to be one of the top five strikers in the world; he is powerful, fast, technically at the top level and when he is physically at his best it is very difficult to stop him. ""But I want to tell him that nothing is more important then the team, including the coach."" Adebayor came out of a self-imposed international exile to play in the 0-0 draw with Tunisia in last month's Nations Cup qualifier. It was his first game since June 2015 and the striker, who is currently with English Premier League side Crystal Palace, has long had a difficult relationship with the Togo Football Association as well as nations team coaches, including LeRoy's predecessor Saintfiet. And following his return to the Togo set-up there have been reports that Adebayor is already unhappy again. ""I need to have a big chat with him,"" added LeRoy. ""I like him and I was also very close with him even though I have not been his coach. We have a important Nations Cup qualifier against Liberia in June. ""I don't like the term 'star player' because when you see a star in the sky it is completely dark around it. I prefer a player to be like the sun, shining light on all the people around them. Star players belong in individual sport, not in football. I will try to explain this to him."" While the immediate task is to try to get Adebayor on side, LeRoy realises that there is much work to be done to ensure a new group of Togolese players will come through to take the place of the 32-year-old and others reaching the end of their career. ""Togo has a lot of good young players but we have to solve some problems,"" said LeRoy, who has coached in Africa for over 30 years and is familiar with the problems at grassroots level on the continent. ""I told the Togo FA we need to work on improving local football in the country. At the moment there is no championship, only the Cup of Independence. ""They need to start a new championship. I have to find local talent and to work with local coaches to prepare the next generation.""

"The singer-songwriter is one of 85 people from Northern Ireland who have been recognised for their achievements. The Belfast-born musician, whose full name is George Ivan Morrison, will be known as Sir George. He described his new title as a ""huge honour"". Some of the 69-year-old star's biggest hits include Brown Eyed Girl, Moondance and, fittingly, Here Comes the Night. His knighthood has been granted for ""services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland"". In a statement on Friday, Morrison said: ""Throughout my career I have always preferred to let my music speak for me, and it is a huge honour to now have that body of work recognised in this way. ""I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have supported me on my musical journey."" Morrison was born into a working-class family in east Belfast in 1945 but his exceptional talent has made him a global recording star. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as ""one of the greatest singers of all time"". The son of Harland and Wolff shipyard worker, he grew up in a small terraced house in Hyndford Street, in the shadow of the shipyard's famous cranes. His father's extensive record collection exposed the younger Morrison to a huge range of American musicians, including Hank Williams, Ray Charles, and Muddy Waters. Those early influences filtered into Morrison's own eclectic style which mixes soul, blues, jazz and country music with pop and rock. As well as selling millions of records worldwide, he has won six Grammys and a Brit award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. His relationship with stardom and the media has not always been comfortable. In 1993, he became the first living recipient not to attend his own induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, more recently he has accepted other accolades in person, including honorary degrees from both of Northern Ireland's universities. Last year, he was granted the freedom of his native city and celebrated the honour by playing a free concert at Belfast's Waterfront Hall. In total, 53 men and 32 women from Northern Ireland have been honoured by the Queen for their achievements in a range of fields and for their contribution to public life. The second highest honour, Companion of the Bath (CB) was given to the top civil servant at Stormont's Department for Social Development, William Haire, while the chief executive of Belfast Harbour Commissioners, Robert Adair, becomes a Commander of the British Empire (CBE). Also honoured is one of Northern Ireland leading exponents of the Chinese lion dance, Yuk Shan Lui. PSNI Assistant chief Constable Will Kerr receives an OBE.

"Laura Beal has served with the Devon and Cornwall force for 13 years as a police constable and even featured in a force advertising campaign. In her letter she says inadequate staffing has made it ""impossible to do her job to the best of her ability"". It comes as inspectors warn police cuts are putting the public at risk. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Beal said she was prompted to put her resignation letter on Facebook after her sergeant told her it was unlikely to be seen by the Chief Constable, Shaun Sawyer. Reality Check: Did the government protect police funding? She said she followed her father into the police when she was 19 and had always been proud to say she was a PC, but now felt ""embarrassed at the way everyone is being treated"". In her letter she claims she was expected to go on patrol covering Mid Devon with one other officer most days. ""This is meant to be adequate and safe. How this can be acceptable is beyond belief,"" she wrote. Ms Beal's resignation comes as the police standards watchdog warned some forces are putting the public at risk by rationing responses as they struggle with cutbacks. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said some forces had ""downgraded"" 999 calls, in order to justify responding to them more slowly. Its report found most of the 43 forces in England and Wales were providing a good service. But that others have let victims down. Ms Beale said the job had left her suffering from stress and anxiety. ""Your staff are not coping, and are suffering because there is no one looking out for them. ""Front line response is where you need to focus your time and money. This is where the buck stops,"" she added.

"Mitch Achurch put the visitors ahead within three minutes but former Leeds wing Ben Jones-Bishop cut the deficit. Brad Singleton went over either side of half-time, while Sutcliffe helped to kick Leeds into a formidable lead. As the game drew to a close, Sutcliffe went over himself to help seal Leeds' fifth Super League win of the season. The game marked the return to the side for Zak Hardaker on the wing, the reigning Man of Steel whose future at Leeds is up in the air after the club placed him on the transfer list by request.

"MLAs have spent most of Tuesday debating the welfare reform bill, which has reached the consideration stage in Stormont's legislative process. The day's proceedings adjourned at 22:00 GMT but will resume on Wednesday. Welfare reform had caused an impasse until a deal was reached at December's inter-party talks in Stormont House. Politicians agreed to set aside tens of millions of pounds for a fund designed to provide financial support for those adversely impacted by welfare changes. Mr Robinson said the financial cost of not implementing welfare reform would have been at such a level that ""we could not have sustained an executive"". He said that other parties could not have an ""a la carte"" approach to the Stormont House Agreement. ""If people genuinely want to move forward in Northern Ireland, then it is important this legislation goes through. It's important that the parties uphold the agreement that all of us reached,"" he said. At the start of the debate, the DUP was accused of ""killing off discussion"" of the bill. Ulster Unionist Roy Beggs said the DUP had done so by tabling a series of petitions of concern against amendments to the bill. ""They have displayed the undemocratic nature of their attitudes as MLAs and the undemocratic nature of their party, which of course has the word democracy in their name,"" he said. Mr Robinson rejected Mr Beggs' claim that his party's actions were ""shameful"". The measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont's power-sharing assembly. If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support. In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions. Apart from the amendments tabled by Social Development Minister Mervyn Storey of the DUP, only two others - put forward by the UUP - survived. However, Mr Robinson, the first minister, said assembly members were still capable of discussing the bill as well as the amendments. The SDLP's Alex Attwood accused the DUP of trying to run a ""coach and horses"" through the amendments. ""Never before in the life of the chamber has there been such a swingeing attempt through petitions of concern to shut down what might be good law for the people of this part of the world,"" he said. Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said some SDLP assembly members were defying their party leader Alasdair McDonnell by tabling the amendments in the chamber. ""The SDLP dissidents are clearly now in charge of the party and are prepared to risk the collapse of the Stormont House Agreement - and thereby the power-sharing institutions themselves - for the sake of party political grandstanding,"" he said. Generally, Northern Ireland Assembly bills reach their consideration stage a few months after MLAs first debate their principles. The fact that two years and four months have passed since this bill was last on the floor of the chamber shows just how difficult the arguments over welfare reform have been. However, the essential deal was struck before Christmas, with the parties accepting the introduction of universal credit and personal independence payments, to replace benefits such as jobseeker's allowance, tax credits and disability living allowance. Stormont is providing support for those adversely impacted financially by the changes to the welfare system by setting aside nearly £30m to assist claimants who lose out in 2015/16. Sinn Féin has claimed the fund will amount to more than £500m over the next six years.",First Minister Peter Robinson has said the cost of not implementing welfare reform would have led to the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive.,"['The summary includes the first name of the first minister, which is not found in the source text.']",[],0
"Tests by Southampton University found people's walking patterns - their gait - are so different they could be used to identify individuals. Researchers used a multi-biometric tunnel with 12 synchronised cameras to capture and translate 25 subjects' gaits to build unique 3D images. It is hoped the technique could be used for a variety of purposes, including security monitoring at airports. 'Extreme clothing changes' Darko Matovski, who led the investigation, said: ""We have shown for the first time that gait can be used as a reliable biometric trait over time."" The team believes the technique could be used in airport immigration halls where ""a simple corridor with cameras"" would be enough to identify large flows of people. Mr Matovski, from the university's school of electronics and computer science, added: ""A bank robber may wear a mask so you can't see his face, wear gloves so you can't get fingerprints, wear a hat so you can't get DNA evidence - but he still has to walk into the bank and you can identify him from the walk."" With almost 2,000 walking sequences recorded in a database, Mr Matovski claims a 95% success rate. Gait can also be measured at a distance - an advantage over other forms of biometric identification.

That is not to say there have not been some difficult times along the way. Last week a stomach bug left her vomiting and meant she had to battle through the 26 miles, walking some of the sections. Overall, however, she said the challenge had been a ""fun"" experience. ""I was inspired by Larry Macon who ran across the states,"" Ms Hughes said. ""I didn't really start by wanting to break a record, I just looked at a map of the major cities in the UK and wanting to run in them. ""I've met loads of lovely people and run in some really nice places. Down south, Brighton and Bournemouth were really pretty and the weather was amazing."" In all, Ms Hughes has covered more than 1,300 miles, running in cities such as London, Liverpool, Wolverhampton, Newcastle, Glasgow and Cardiff. Other runners have joined Amy Hughes along the way and she has had plenty of support, especially on marathon number 50, in her home town of Oswestry, in Shropshire. ""The support was amazing, very emotional. Loads of people came out."" It was also the first time some of her friends and family had seen her since she started the challenge and hundreds of pupils from the Marches School ran a mile with her.

"Monarch, easyJet, Thomson Airways and Thomas Cook Airlines have now cancelled all outbound flights to the Egyptian resort up to 25 November.

"Marshall Leonard is being held by police after throwing a bomb into one of the department stores in Tupelo, Mississippi, early on Sunday. Mr Leonard is known in the city for the 4ft (1.2m) flag he flies over his car. Nobody was hurt or injured by the improvised device that produced only a loud bang but no damage. ""An employee was sitting in the vestibule taking a break. He told the employee to run - that he was going to blow the place up,"" said Police Chief Bart Aguirre. The suspect then threw the newspaper-wrapped package into the store - around 0130 local time (0630 GMT). Walmart, along with several other retailers, pulled the battle flag and other memorabilia from their shelves following the killing in June of nine black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. The man charged with the killings was pictured holding the flag. Explosives experts said that the package contained enough explosive material to damage the store, but its poor assembly rendered it ineffective. He was arrested by police about a half-hour later when his silver Mazda adorned with stickers of battle flag and the Mississippi state flag - which itself features an inset Confederate battle flag - was seen running a red traffic light.

"The Mourne County were 4-1 outsiders for their semi-final against Monaghan but clinched a 1-14 to 0-15 victory.

""But we know that it's going to be a huge task."" 1991 and 1994 All-Ireland medallist Burns endured a torrid start to his Down managerial stint as his side lost 11 straight competitive games before a remarkable escape act earlier this year saw them avoid a second successive league relegation as they remained in Division Two. ""When I took over the job, I knew there were going to be tough times ahead. I had prepared for that but at times there was quite a bit of undue criticism of the team,"" adds the Down boss. ""Whenever I took the job, I lost maybe eight or 10 players and they were the most experienced players in the panel. ""So you are starting from scratch as such. You are having to start and build a panel and you are bringing in young and inexperienced players who might have played at minor and under-21 level. ""There is a massive step up from under-21 to having to play at senior level. But we worked away, we kept our heads down, we introduced quite a few players and the ball is starting to roll in the right direction for us."" Burns believes the concluding league draw in Cork which kept Down in Division Two as Derry and Fermanagh suffered the drop was a key moment in his team's development. ""We knew we were going to have to get something when we were down there and it had been a long time since Down had got anything in Cork. ""We had a tough second half with them but we battled it out and the result kept us in Division Two and gave us a platform to build on in the lead-in to the championship."" Despite avoiding the drop to join Armagh in Division Three, Down still went into the Ulster derby against the Orchard County on 4 June as underdogs but the Mournemen produced a composed second-half display to earn a deserved 0-15 to 2-7 victory. ""We knew if we performed on the day that we had a massive chance of beating Armagh. That result gave us a great boost and then we had another great win against Monaghan."" Burns' matter of fact description of belies the emotion he showed at the final whistle of the provincial semi-final in the Athletic Grounds as he emotionally embraced the Down county secretary Sean Og McAteer.

"802 Works Ltd claims the club has not paid a bill for work at Ibrox and wants the cash frozen to ensure payment if Rangers go bust. Rangers say the firm breached the contract as the system cannot be used by 50,000 people at the same time. A sheriff will rule on Friday whether an arrestment warrant granted two weeks ago should remain or be lifted. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, lawyers for 802 Works said the firm wanted the money ring-fenced to ensure payment if the club goes into insolvency. The court was told that Rangers ""over a considerable period"", had been operating at a loss of £7.5m per year. Various accounts were lodged at the court, including an audited report dated October 2015, showing financial information and an account showing more recent figures that were taken from the club's account system. The most recent figures were objected to by the representative of 802 Works. Solicitor advocate Simon Catto, representing 802 Works, said the audited report showed a full year's accounts and a loss of around £7.5m per year should be preferred. He said: ""These are the only documents that should be looked at when considering if there is a risk of insolvency."" Counsel for the club, Christopher Wilson, told the court that the sum sued for is 2% of the turnover. He said: ""The company is turning over that amount each week."" The court heard Rangers have repaid a £5m loan from Sports Direct. Mr Catto said the defence case, that only 10,000 users could access the Wi-Fi in the stadium and that constituted a breach of contract, was ""feeble"".

Figures show more rapes are being reported in general, which is a sign that the crime is being taken more seriously, our correspondent reports.

""Unfortunately, I had to tell them it was too late for them to file a lawsuit against Bill Cosby because of the statute of limitations - for most women it is simply too late to have their day in court,"" she told reporters. The women's rights lawyer presented two courses of action to, in her words, ""determine whether Bill Cosby is a saint or a sexual predator"". Firstly, she suggested Mr Cosby waive the statute of limitations to allow the alleged victims to present their claims and for him to present his defence. The second option, she said, would be for Mr Cosby to place $100m (Â£64m) in a fund, from which a panel of retired judges would decide what compensation would be appropriate if a woman's claim was found to have merit. Three women then gave accounts of the alleged attacks, with two saying they had been drugged before being assaulted. When asked how many women had contacted her to make a claim, Ms Allred said: ""I literally have lost count."" The press conference came a day after another woman filed a lawsuit against Mr Cosby over allegations of sexual assault when she was under-age - said to be the first such claim to come to light. Judy Huth says she was 15 when she was molested by the comedian at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. As she was minor at the time, her case can still be heard. Earlier this week, Bill Cosby resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia, where he was once a student, amid the allegations. Several broadcasters have also shelved projects with Mr Cosby, including NBC and Netflix. Two of his performances scheduled for the weekend at a venue in the north of New York were cancelled on Wednesday, AP reports. Nearly half of the audience of the show in Tarrytown had reportedly requested refunds. In 2005 a woman who accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her brought a lawsuit against him, but the case was settled out of court.",Veteran US lawyer Gloria Allred says she has lost count of the number of women who have contacted her to make sexual assault claims against comedian Bill Cosby.,"[""Ms Allred's first name is not in the source text"", 'The summary describes Gloria Allred as a ""veteran"", but the source text does not provide this information.', 'The summary claims she is a US laywer, but the source text does not say she is from the US']",[],0

"Catherine Burns, 29, left Ireland for the US in 1832 to begin a new life, but within six weeks she was dead. A funeral mass and burial took place at St Patrick's Church in Clonoe, near Coalisland. She was one of 57 Irish migrants hired to build a stretch of railway in Pennsylvania known as Duffy's Cut. Within six weeks of arriving in Philadelphia, all 57 workers - who hailed from counties Donegal, Tyrone and Londonderry - were dead. It is thought some died from cholera, while others were murdered by local people who believed the immigrants were spreading the disease. Most were buried anonymously in a mass grave near the shanty town where they lived and worked, but Catherine was among several workers buried separately. Officials with the Philadelphia and Columbia railroad never notified the immigrants' families of their deaths. Parish priest Father Benny Fee told the funeral: ""Catherine is one of our own, she's no stranger, she has Tyrone blood in her veins, but we know so little about her. ""What we do know is that she knew suffering. She was married and already widowed at the tender age of 29 - before she was 30 she had loved and lost. We also know she knew poverty, she knew what it was to have nothing in her purse. ""She took the boat to the USA for no other reason than she had no choice - she could stay at home and starve, or she could gamble on taking a boat across the Atlantic and with a bit of luck catch the tail of the American dream. ""But as Christy Moore's song Duffy's Cut says so well, she was sailing into Hell and less than two months into her arrival in the new world, she and her 56 Irish companions in Duffy's Cut were dead and buried in unmarked graves."" This is the second repatriation of remains found at Duffy's Cut, now a wooded area behind suburban homes in the borough of Malvern, about 20 miles west of Philadelphia. In 2013, 18-year-old John Ruddy was reburied at Ardara, County Donegal. An investigation into what happened to the 57 Irish workers began in 2002, when Malvern's Immaculata University professor Bill Watson, his twin brother Frank, a Lutheran minister, and fellow Immaculata professor Earl Schandelmeier, began the Duffy's Cut archival and research project. The trio accompanied Catherine on her journey home to County Tyrone and attended the wake and the funeral in Clonoe. Fr Fee thanked them for the ""courtesy and respect they have shown our Tyrone Catherine"". He added: ""You have brought Catherine back from her exile to her native pastures. Now there's no fear, no terror for Catherine anymore.""",The funeral has taken place of a County Tyrone woman who died 183 years ago while working in the United States.,"[""Source text does not support the summary's assertion that the woman died 183 years ago.""]",[],0
"The Portadown Times published results from what it said was an ""independent"" poll ahead of May's general election. But it failed to acknowledge that the survey had actually been commissioned by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Mr Nesbitt said the article ""appears to have skewed"" the election result. The article suggested that the gap in support between the DUP and Sinn Féin had narrowed. The results put the DUP candidate David Simpson in first place with 30.7% of the vote, with Sinn Féin in second place on 28.1%. The Ulster Unionist candidate, Jo-Anne Dobson, was third in the poll, with 25% of the vote. Mr Simpson held his House of Commons seat for Upper Bann in the election with 15,430 votes, with Mrs Dobson polling 13,166 votes to finish in second place. The Ulster Unionist Party said the publication of the article suggested to readers that a vote for Mrs Dobson would have would ""split the pro-union vote, and risk the seat being taken by Sinn Féin"". The Independent Press Standards Office (IPSO) upheld Mr Nesbitt's complaint that the newspaper's description of the poll as ""independent"" had misled readers. IPSO said the Portadown Times had also failed to inform readers that the poll had been conducted six weeks before it was published. Mr Nesbitt said his party's canvassing team felt the publication of the ""out-of-date"" survey had ""provoked a dramatic mood-swing on the doorstep"". ""I have no doubt David Simpson will do the decent thing and call a by-election, so the people of Upper Bann can vote without the artificial shadow of fear hanging over their ballot papers,"" he added.

"The seven-hour standoff started after police tried to execute a warrant for the arrest of Korryn Gaines. Gaines, who was armed with a shotgun, was shot dead in her apartment while her 5-year-old son watched. Police said her followers on Facebook encouraged her not to give in. According to Facebook's policies, accounts can be suspended if law enforcement believe individuals are at risk of harm. Police Chief Jim Johnson has said their decision to request a de-activation was based upon the fact Gaines had a gun and a child was present during her standoff with officers. Gaines' social media accounts have been restored. But two videos are missing and are being withheld for violating Facebook's standards - which include a provision against inciting violence. Videos posted on Gaines' Instagram appear to show her talking to her son during the standoff. In one clip, Gaines questions her son about the situation unfolding outside, with a police officer visible through her open door. ""What [are the police] trying to do?"" she asks the boy. ""They're trying to kill us,' he replies. Officers claim Gaines threatened to shoot them if they entered her apartment and that she fired shots several times.

"The company behind the project at Woodburn Forest, near Carrickfergus, is set to formally end its application for a court order to stop alleged trespassing and obstruction, according to a lawyer in the case. Lawyers for InfraStrata had issued High Court proceedings against 10 people after a notice was issued for opponents to vacate the site last week. At one stage, a judge had warned that he would ban them from going near the area if they blocked work getting underway. However, with contractors able to move in without obstruction, the case had been adjourned to Friday for a further update. It was indicated that the legal application is set to be formally discontinued. Outside court, solicitor Mark O'Connor, representing some of the protestors, said: ""My clients are delighted with the resolution to this matter, where they are no longer to face injunction proceedings. ""They don't believe this case should ever have been brought in the first place."" The Stop the Drill campaign group is objecting to a controversial borehole to search for oil and gas in the area, saying it is part of the catchment for a reservoir supplying water to homes in Belfast and Carrickfergus. They claim chemicals used in the drill process could leach into the water table. But Northern Ireland Water, which leased the site to InfraStrata, insists the project will not compromise the water supply. Groundwater will also be protected by measures, including the drill shaft being encased in steel and concrete, according to the firm. Last week, Mid and East Antrim Council approved a waste management plan - effectively paving the way for four months of work on the site to begin. During a previous hearing, a lawyer for InfraStrata said a protest camp was in operation since March. He claimed groups of up to 25 people gathered during earlier, preliminary stages in the project. At one stage cars were used to block off the entrance to the site, he said. Any further disruption will have financial consequences for a project costing Â£8,000 a day, the court heard. It was argued that the company has a right of way on private land and was only taking the minimal step of seeking an injunction at this stage. A lawyer representing some of the 10 defendants insisted his clients had neither trespassed nor caused obstruction. He also stressed the international concern at what he described as a world-first attempt to drill in a water catchment area. But with the case now apparently settled, Mr O'Connor said both sides will bear their own legal costs.",A legal bid to halt work on a controversial oil and gas borehole in County Antrim has been dropped.,"['The summary makes up the County this occurred in', 'The summary states that the legal bid was to halt work on the borehole, but the text indicates the legal bid was to stop alleged trespassing and obstruction, not to halt the work itself.

"Strachan received the backing of the SFA board last week despite his side sitting fifth place in their World Cup qualifying group. Speculation had linked Sunderland manager Moyes with the job. ""I don't think there's anybody out there who could do a better job than Gordon Strachan,"" said Moyes, whose side beat Hull City 3-0 on Saturday. The Scot had been under pressure in the first year of his own four-year contract with the English Premier League club. But the win over Hull lifts Sunderland above Swansea City and off the bottom of the table. Moyes has often said that he would like to manage his country at some point but was unhappy to be linked with the role with Strachan still in post. ""Quite rightly so that they kept Gordon on, because he's got a limited group to choose from,"" said the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad boss. ""I think Scotland did well against England. I think that the score flattered England a little bit. ""And I think Gordon's working with the tools he's got and deserves to be in the position."" Scotland's 3-0 defeat by the English at Wembley left the Scots six points behind the Group F leaders and four adrift of second-top Slovenia. However, Ross County winger Chris Burke, who has seven Scotland caps, thinks Strachan's side can still finish second and secure a play-off place. ""The way we have to look at it is - are we going to finish first, or did we think we were going to finish first?"" he told BBC Scotland. ""No, we weren't. Realistically, we were looking at coming second and is that still a possibility? Of course it is. ""It is only four points and the team that are in second are coming next to Hampden and, if we beat them, it is back on. ""One thing about Gordon is he is a fantastic coach and I've learned so much in my game when I was at the age of 30 when he introduced me back into the Scotland squad."" Former Scotland left-back Gary Naysmith agreed about Strachan's qualities. ""Everybody says on the training pitch, you won't find anyone better,"" said the East Fife manager. ""I've never heard one person say anything bad about Gordon Strachan's coaching. ""I thought there was a lot of optimism from the England game, but I can also understand when you look at the statistics why some of the fans are wanting a change. ""But you hear what David Moyes had to say there - another manager would have the same group of players.

Relatives of L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, paid tribute saying he had died ""in the pursuit of his dream"". Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced a full inquiry. We, Craig's family, would like to thank all our and Craig's friends for their kind thoughts and support. We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig; this has left a massive hole in all our lives. We wholeheartedly supported Craig in his military endeavours and it gives us some comfort, though great sadness, that he died in the pursuit of his dream. Next month Craig was due to start a new post in the office of the secretary of state for education and we were all very proud of him. We would like to thank the Ministry of Defence family liaison officer for all his help and support in these trying times. Speaking to Channel 4 news, Mr Capstick described how he was walking in the Beacons when he was passed by a line of soldiers moving in the opposite direction at five or 10-minute intervals. ""We then came across two soldiers who had clearly broken that intended mode of operation and were proceeding slowly together, and one of the soldiers made a compassionate plea for some drinking water for his colleague,"" he said. ""He was upset,"" he added. ""The other soldier was trying to make the best of the situation and asked if we could spare any water for his colleague, not for himself."" Mr Capstick added that it ""certainly was slightly odd"" that the two soldiers in particular had bunched together and were ""clearly in distress.""

It is believed he served as a reservist in Iraq and Afghanistan, and had taken part in several exercises including a training mission in Texas with the American National Guard. He had taken part in a four-week trial for the TA SAS reservists ending in a 40-mile (64km) hike over the Brecon Beacons.

"The Dismaland show - which will also feature work from Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer and Jimmy Cauty - will take over the Tropicana site for five weeks. ""I loved the Tropicana as a kid, so getting to throw these doors open again is a real honour,"" Banksy said. The show is his first in the UK since 2009's Banksy v Bristol Museum show which drew huge crowds. Banksy described the show as a ""family theme park unsuitable for children"". He said he had been motivated to work on the site which had been ""popular with low income holiday makers"" after peering through a gap in the fence in January. Many of the works require ""audience participation"". ""A dead princess is only complete when surrounded by gawping crowds with their cameras out, or the opportunity to photograph yourself pulling an amazed expression when a killer whale leaps from a toilet,"" he said. ""I guess you'd say it's a theme park whose big theme is 'theme parks should have bigger themes'."" Dismaland is the official name but it's really Banksyland. Subversive, darkly comic and cocking a snook at authority there are good reasons why the mysterious Mr Banksy is so popular. His stencils are well known but this is something very different - a pitch black antidote to the 'fun day out'. The Julie Burchill 'Punch and Judy', the riot torn village, the 'magic castle' with a paparazzi and Disney centrepiece and, of course, an exit through the gift shop. Fun for all the family? No. Something Britain's seaside has never seen before? Yes. Weston is bracing itself for crowds. Speculation had been growing that the elusive Bristolian was planning an exhibition after a castle and sculpture made from tanker trucks were spotted above the walls. Locals had been told a Hollywood company was filming there. Nigel Ashton, leader of North Somerset Council, said: ""We have been working closely with the organisers for months now and, for obvious reasons, have had to remain tight-lipped about the true nature of the event. ""In fact, only four people in the entire council knew what was really happening."" The transformation inside the Tropicana is quite stunning. It's still the run-down lido it has been for the past 15 years, but now there's art everywhere. From the moment you walk through the fake airport-style security you get the dismal tone of Dismaland. Grumpy guards play the part astonishingly well. Inside you see Banksy's Cinderella castle and his Grim Reaper dodgem, which dances to the song Staying Alive. But you also get a heavy dose of other local and international artists. Damien Hirst makes contributions alongside others. And the organisers are keen to point to the show's art credentials rather than it being just street art alone. The Tropicana outdoor pool and leisure facility closed in 2000 due to falling visitor numbers. Since then, there has been various attempts to either reopen or demolish the structure. The Trop Trust is trying to reopen the structure and bring it back into use.

"Set in a grand retirement home for ageing musicians, Quartet marks the 75-year-old's debut as a film director. The film has its gala screening at the London Film Festival on Monday night. Based on Ronald Harwood's play, Quartet is set in a home for retired musicians, where old rivalries are stirred up by the arrival of former opera singer Jean Horton (Dame Maggie Smith). She is joined in the cast by British heavyweights Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly, Pauline Collins and Michael Gambon. But Hoffman, who says the the story is about people in their ""third act"", hired a supporting cast of real-life elderly performers to give his film authenticity.

To address this, the charity wants to increase the Â£2.37m it raises annually in Wales to help youngsters dealing with things like poverty, homelessness, disability and bereavement to help reach more people. Barnardo's Cymru director Sarah Crawley called the confidence study results ""a wake up call"".

"Norfolk-based Gardline, founded by the Darling family in 1969, employs 750 people and has been bought by Dutch firm, Royal Boskalis Westminster. Gardline's activities include marine geophysical surveys, offshore geotechnical services and environmental surveys. Boskalis has taken on the firm's assumed debt as part of the deal. In a joint statement, the firms said there were ""significant synergies"" between them. Gardline operates 40 vessels, including crew transfer ships and survey catamarans.

"United are reported to have agreed an £18.9m fee for the keeper and Sir Alex Ferguson hopes to wrap up a deal soon. Former United forward Forlan told BBC Sport: ""David will become a top player because he has a lot of ability. ""But he's only just had his first full season as Atletico's number one and is a young guy with little experience."" Last month, Ferguson said he regarded De Gea as the natural replacement for Edwin van der Sar, who retired after United's Champions League final defeat by Barcelona, and admitted he had been tracking the Spaniard for ""quite a while"". De Gea is currently playing for Spain at the European Under-21 Championships in Denmark, and says he wants to wait until the end of the tournament before signing a deal with United. Forlan, 32, who played for United from 2002 to 2004, has been hugely impressed with De Gea since the Spaniard forced his way into Atletico's team towards the end of the 2009/10 season. ""There's no doubt that David will become a very, very good player, because he has the talent,"" Forlan said. ""He is tall, strong on crosses, a good shot stopper and distributes the ball very well. ""I suppose he is similar to Van der Sar in a lot of ways. Even though he is very young, he gives a lot of confidence to his defenders and has a lot of talent."" Forlan joined United for £7.5m from Argentine side Independiente, but failed to cement a regular starting place at the club. He famously went 27 games before scoring for his new side and only hit the net 10 times in 63 games before moving to Villarreal. David is from a little town outside Madrid, has been at Atletico since he was very young and doesn't speak any languages other than Spanish . He admitted he does have concerns that De Gea, who came through the youth ranks at Atletico, could become homesick in Manchester. ""You never know for sure whether a player will adapt to a new country until he gets there,"" the Uruguayan said. ""It's true that I was also young when I joined United, just 22, but you can't compare our situations. ""I knew the language and had already left my country, having moved to Independiente when I was only 19. So it was not such a big step for me to go to United. ""David is from a little town outside Madrid and has been at Atletico since he was very young. He doesn't speak any languages other than Spanish. He is going over with his girlfriend and family though, which will help."" Forlan revealed that De Gea had been hungry for insights into life with the English champions. ""I told him that Manchester United is a great place to experience as a player and that I had a great time there,"" he added. ""The manager and staff are fantastic and the fans were always very supportive of me, even when I wasn't scoring. I made some good friends there and settled in well. Maybe the weather wasn't always what I wanted, but I had a great experience. ""David really wants to go to United, there's no question about that. He wants the challenge and he wants the experience.

"Goals in either half from Jackson Irvine and Brian Graham earned them all three points. Motherwell's late response began with Stephen Pearson's fierce strike. But Scott Fox saved from James McFadden and brilliantly kept out a Keith Lasley drive to frustrate Motherwell. It was a pulsating finish to a game that only sparked into life when Irvine fired in the opening goal. The Australian was only drafted into the starting line-up minutes before the match because of an injury in the warm-up to Martin Woods. And he made a great case for his inclusion when he deftly controlled a deep corner before lashing the ball past Connor Ripley, despite the best efforts of Kieran Kennedy on the line. Fox saved well from a Louis Moult header and Chris Cadden as Motherwell tried to mount a swift response, but County regained the ascendancy at the start of the second half. Playing principally on the counter-attack, they went close on a number of occasions, with Michael Gardyne having a header cleared off the line and passing up another great chance with a low drive that was blocked. They got the second goal their play deserved when Graham slotted past Ripley as the Motherwell defence failed to deal with a Stewart Murdoch cross. That looked like game over until Pearson's late strike - the midfielder blasting past Fox from 12 yards. But the keeper was sharply off his line to prevent McFadden's lob beating him and he sprung to his right to deny Lasley a spectacular equaliser. The result leaves Motherwell just a point above the relegation play-off spot and County in good spirits ahead of next weekend's League Cup semi-final against Celtic.",Ross County moved off the bottom of the Premiership with victory over Motherwell.,"['The summary names them Ross County, but the source text calls them County.', 'The summary states that County moved off the bottom of the Premiership, but the source text does not mention their position in the league or that they were at the bottom.

"French media reported that a five-year deal had been agreed to host the race at Le Castellet, near Marseille. Ecclestone told Reuters: ""Yes, I think it will happen,"" adding that it would be held in late July, not a month later as the initial reports had suggested. France hosted the first ever grand prix in 1906 but lost its slot in 2008. There have been several attempts since to revive the race but this one looks to be the first to succeed. A news conference has been organised for an announcement about the future of the French Grand Prix in Paris on Monday, to be hosted by Christian Estrosi, the president of the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. The French sports newspaper L'Equipe reported that a five-year deal had been agreed with the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region in association with the city of Toulon, department of Var and the French motorsport association. Le Castellet - also known as the Circuit Paul Ricard - last hosted the French Grand Prix in 1990. From 1991-2008 it was held at Magny-Cours in central France. Ecclestone's family trust owns the track but the 86-year-old said: ""It's nothing to do with them at all. I think they are renting it to the people that are going to be the promoters."" He said the race would be held on ""more or less sort of the German date probably"", without specifying what that meant for the future of the German Grand Prix. That race has dropped off the calendar for next year because the Nurburgring, one of two venues that alternate as hosts, cannot meet its financial obligations under its contract with F1. But Hockenheim, which held the race in 2016, has a contract to do so again in 2018. The return of France will be greeted with widespread delight by both F1 insiders and fans of the sport. This is because of its historic significance and because it is another race in the sport's heartland of Europe rather than, as has been the recent trend for new events, in a country where the sport has limited support and no heritage. F1 is in the process of being bought by US group Liberty Media, and it has said that protecting races in F1's heartland is a major priority, along with expanding its presence in the US, the rest of the Americas and Asia.","The French Grand Prix will return to the Formula 1 calendar in 2018, says F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone.","[""The summary gives Ecclestone's title which not mentioned in the source text."", ""The summary gives Ecclestone's first name which not mentioned in the source text."", 'The summary states the French Grand Prix will return in 2018 but the source text indicates it will be the following year.

""We can spoof yos from any users, and we can spam any user... We could also send any Yo user a push notification with any text we want (though we decided not to do that)."" Other developers have been able to recreate the flaw. Similar problems have hit apps such as Snapchat and Tinder in the past few months.

"Martin McCauley was seriously wounded and a teenager was killed when police opened fire on a hayshed in County Armagh in 1982. It later emerged that the security services had secretly recorded what happened. The evidence was not made available to the court during his trial. The 52-year-old, from Lurgan, County Armagh, was arrested along with Niall Connolly and James Monaghan in Colombia in 2001 and accused of IRA training of rebel FARC guerrilla forces. They were initially cleared of the charge, only to be convicted on appeal and sentenced to 17 years in jail. But the three men avoided imprisonment by fleeing Colombia in 2004, turning up in the Republic of Ireland a year later. Even though Mr McCauley faces extradition to South America if he returns to Northern Ireland, the Court of Appeal in Belfast is examining a weapons conviction for which he received a two-year suspended jail sentence. Police claimed Martin McCauley confronted them with a rifle at a hayshed 32 years ago during the so-called RUC shoot to kill incident. He was seriously injured and Michael Tighe was killed when RUC officers opened fire. In 1985, Martin McCauley was convicted of possession of three rifles found inside the shed and given a two-year suspended sentence. He had insisted he and Michael Tighe, had not been armed and that the police opened fire without warning. The police told the court that was not true. Years after his conviction, it was revealed that MI5 had a listening device hidden inside the hayshed at the time of the shooting that recorded what happened. That recording could have re-established whether the police issued any warnings or made any reference to Mr McCauley being armed before they opened fire. The existence of the recording was not made known to the court at the time of his trial. Its existence was discovered by the former Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir John Stalker, as part of his investigation into allegations that the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was operating a shoot to kill policy. He also discovered that the recording was later destroyed. Last year, the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred his case to the Court of Appeal, on the basis that potentially significant material had been withheld from the judge. In a dramatic development on Wednesday, Gerald Simpson QC told the court he had been instructed to read a statement on behalf of the prosecution service. It said material relevant to the decision to prosecute Mr McCauley was withheld from the director of public prosecutions at the time, from the court and from the defence in the trial. The statement said this served only to undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system and to bring it into disrepute. The lawyer told the three Appeal Court judges that the prosecution service would not be making any submissions to uphold the conviction and invited them to exercise their discretion to quash it. The judges will sit next week to decide whether to do so. Mr McCauley's lawyers will argue that the conviction should be quashed on the basis that vital evidence was not available to the trial judge. The contents of John Stalker's investigation into the incident have never been made public. The lawyers hope that will change during next week's hearing. ""Mr McCauley was tried in public, and he was convicted in public and it's his fundamental right that these documents be opened in the public court, so that he and the general public are aware of what actually occurred,"" Mr McCauley's lawyer, Fearghal Shiels, said.

"The revolutionary technology will allow wind power to be harvested in waters too deep for the current conventional bottom-standing turbines used. The Peterhead wind farm, known as Hywind, is a trial which will bring power to 20,000 homes. Manufacturer Statoil says output from the turbines is expected to equal or surpass generation from current ones. It hopes to cash in on a boom in the technology, especially in Japan and the West coast of the US, where waters are deep. ""This is a tech development project to ensure it's working in open sea conditions. It's a game-changer for floating wind power and we are sure it will help bring costs down,"" said Leif Delp, project director for Hywind. So far, one giant turbine has already been moved into place, while four more wait in readiness in a Norwegian fjord. By the end of the month they'll all have been towed to 15 miles off Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, where they'll float upright like giant fishing floats. While the turbines are currently very expensive to make, Statoil believes that in the future it will be able to dramatically reduce costs in the same way that manufacturers already have for conventional offshore turbines. ""I think eventually we will see floating wind farms compete without subsidy - but to do that we need to get building at scale,"" said Mr Delp. The operation to begin shifting the first of the 11,500 tonne giants happened dramatically in the half-light of a Norwegian summer night. Crews secured thick cables to tug boats and used remote-controlled submarines to check for obstacles. Finally the giant was on the move, floating on a sealed vase-like tube 78 metres deep, its bottom filled with iron ore to weight the base and keep it upright in the water. The price of energy from bottom-standing offshore wind farms has plummeted 32% since 2012 - far faster that anyone predicted. The price is now four years ahead of the government's expected target, and another big price drop is expected, taking offshore wind to a much lower price than new nuclear power. The Hywind project is being run in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi firm Masdar. The Â£190m cost was subsidised by bill-payers under the UK government's Renewable Obligation Certificates. The bird charity RSPB Scotland opposed the project - not because it dislikes the technology but because it believes too many offshore turbines in the area have already been approved. It fears thousands of sea birds may be killed by the offshore wind farms, although it admits that estimates are hugely uncertain because it is impossible to count bird corpses at sea. The RSPB's Aidan Smith told BBC News: ""Generally we are very enthusiastic about floating wind technology because it allows turbines to be placed far offshore - away from seabird nesting sites, and it helps us tackle climate change. ""We oppose the Hywind project because it adds to a situation we already believe is a problem."" Floating turbines may create a new frontier for energy - but scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warn far more investment in additional new technologies is urgently needed for governments to keep promises on reducing emissions.

""There was a protest from local farmers who were very suspicious of these strange aquatic plants that Monet wanted to plant because they they would poison their water and kill their cattle,"" she said. Monet, who moved to Giverny in 1883, had been able to buy land on the other side of a railway line that bordered his house. It was here he wanted to create his water garden by diverting the river Epte, a tributary of the Seine. Dumas said Monet acquired planning permission for his garden ""after a lot of difficulty"". ""The farmers were suspicious of Monet anyway,"" she added. ""He kept himself to himself so they saw him as an outsider. When they got wind that he wanted to make a water garden they complained."" The Royal Academy show, which opens next year, looks at the role of gardens in the paintings of Monet and his contemporaries. Its 120 works span the early 1860s to the 1920s. Alongside 35 paintings by Monet will be works by Paul Klee, Emil Nolde, Gustav Klimt and Wassily Kandinsky. ""It will be a show that will be both popular and scholarly,"" said Tim Marlow, the RA's artistic director. ""It isn't just a Monet show - though he is a central figure - and it isn't just an Impressionist show. It involves a whole range of late 19th Century and early 20th-Century artists."" One of the highlights will be Monet's water lily Agapanthus Triptych of 1916 - 1919 - the first time the monumental triptych has been seen in the UK. ""Monet thought of himself as a better gardener then he was a painter,"" said Dumas. ""Not everybody knows what a serious and knowledgeable gardener and horticulturalist Monet was.""

He will still use a BMW 5 series car he inherited from the previous mayor, reports the IOL website. Mr Msimanga's spokesman Matthew Gerstner told the BBC that this vehicle could not ""be dispensed with because it's been bought and paid for already and treasury regulations prohibit that"". He added: ""But, as soon as he can replace it, he will, with a sensible, low-cost vehicle"". Mr Msimango says the DA-led coalition government wanted to embark on cost-cutting measures. He said in a statement: ""No new luxury cars will be bought or leased for politicians‚ and if vehicles currently owned by Tshwane require replacement‚ sensible and low-cost vehicles will be procured. ""I will not allow public money to be spent on luxury cars‚ while our people struggle for services‚ houses and jobs.

"Just days after dropping a supreme court action, the twins filed a fresh lawsuit against the company. It claims that Facebook ""intentionally or inadvertently suppressed evidence"" during their previous litigation. Originally, Tyler and Cameron accused Mr Zuckerberg of stealing their idea to create the site. The story of the feud formed the core of the 2010 film ""The Social Network"". The row dates from 2003 when the Winklevosses hired Mr Zuckerberg to write code for their ConnectU site while at Harvard. He never did, but instead set up Facebook, which quickly became a success around the world. A court case over who did what was resolved in 2008 when the parties agreed on a financial settlement, reportedly worth around $65m (Â£41m). In January 2011 the Winklevosses tried to reopen the case, seeking more money. However, a US appeals court ruled in April that they would have to accept the settlement. The twins initially said they would appeal against the settlement, but decided this week not to pursue that legal avenue. In the most recent suit filed on Thursday with the US District Court of Massachusetts, the Winklevosses and their business partner Divya Narendra said that Facebook hid some crucial information from them during settlement proceedings. The twins said that Mr Zuckerberg did not disclose some important documents in regards to the relationship between him and the brothers while they were at Harvard.

"A total of three devices from the two companies contain cells with 4,000 milliamp-hour (mAh) capacities. That is more than a third higher than the components used in Samsung and Apple's latest flagship phones. Customer surveys have repeatedly highlighted a desire for improved battery life at the top of shopper's most wished for smartphone features. But until now, batteries of this size have been more commonly found in tablets rather than 5.5in (14cm)-screened phones. ""People are constantly engaged with their screens and the screen uses the most power,"" explained Ben Wood from the tech consultancy CCS Insight. ""And the biggest challenge right now is that people are also consuming more video content, thanks to the spread of 4G networks, meaning phone battery life is really getting hammered. ""With the bigger brands people are willing to accept some trade-offs for the phones to appear as slim and slick as possible. ""But everyone else is looking for a way of trying to differentiate their devices. And Lenovo and Acer, in particular, have an eye on the business market where employers want their workers to be available for as many hours as possible."" China-based Lenovo says its new K80 offers up to 33 hours of talk-time and its A5000 up to 35 hours. Both figures are based on the use of a 2G network, which is less energy-intensive than a 3G or 4G connection. Taiwan's Acer has yet to provide a comparable figure for its Liquid X2, which is also unusual for supporting up to three Sim cards at once. ""Following market feedback, we know that battery life is a priority for our customers,"" ST Liew, president of Acer's smartphone business division, told the BBC. ""The 4,000mAh battery is perfect for frequent travellers as it eliminates concerns regarding power, allowing users to be constantly connected whilst on-the-go without the need to carry a charger on a daily basis."" The firms are not the first to use bigger lithium-ion batteries to make their phones stand out. Last year Motorola developed the Moto Maxx, ahead of its takeover by Lenovo. The handset features a 3,900 mAh battery, which the company said should allow it to survive two days between charges. And earlier this month Huawei announced the P8 Max with a 4,360mAh battery - although the size of the device's 6.8in (17.3cm) display means that many people would consider it more a call-enabled tablet than a phone. Some lesser-known handset-makers have opted to fit even bigger, bulkier parts. Philips's Android-powered Xenium W6610, released last year, has a 5,300mAh cell, allowing it to endure up to three days of heavy use. And the recently-released Elephone P5000 currently claims the lead with a 5350mAh battery, which the Chinese company says is large enough to let it stretch to four days of ""continuous use"". At a time when it has become the norm for manufacturers to build smartphones with non-removable batteries, it might be expected that those with bigger capacities would enjoy stronger sales. But one analyst said that despite what shoppers tell surveys, when it comes to buying a personal handset they tend to prioritise other issues such as photo quality, brand or cost. ""If a handset fails to last a minimum of a day then it won't sell, but once you get past that it doesn't really drive demand,"" said Tim Coulling from the market research firm Canalys. ""Most people have at least one opportunity to charge their phone within that time period and there is also a market in battery packs for power-users. ""The other thing is that the more battery life you have the more you end up using your phone anyway.

"Bemba, 53, was accused of failing to stop his rebels from killing and raping people in neighbouring Central African Republic (CAR) in 2002 and 2003. He had sent more than 1,000 fighters to help put down an attempted coup. Bemba, once vice-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, will remain in custody until sentencing. The court in The Hague found him guilty of several charges including rape and murder. He is expected to appeal. It is the first time the ICC has focused on rape as a weapon of war, and the first time a suspect has been convicted over crimes committed by others under his command. The fact that Bemba was convicted for sexual violence is significant. Many Congolese suspects have been accused of such crimes, but this is the first guilty verdict. His conviction was for crimes committed in the Central African Republic, but it will send the message to high-ranking soldiers and militiamen in DR Congo, where sexual violence is rife, that they are responsible for preventing it. But in Congo, despite his murky record, Jean-Pierre Bemba still enjoys significant popularity. Members of his opposition party had hoped he would be released in time to run in the next presidential election, which is scheduled for the end of this year. Welcoming the verdict, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said: ""While the reality of the crimes is appalling, the significance of this decision is to be celebrated. ""What this decision affirms is that commanders are responsible for the acts of the forces under their control."" Carrie Comer, from the International Federation for Human Rights, said the verdict was ""a historic moment for victims of such unspeakable atrocities"". It was ""a strong message from ICC judges that commanders must prevent and punish war crimes,"" she wrote on Twitter. It is alleged that for a period of five months Bemba's Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) rebel fighters killed hundred of civilians, raped women and looted. The court heard horrific accounts, including how a man, his wife, his daughters and his granddaughter were all gang-raped by militiamen. Who is Jean-Pierre Bemba? Profile: Jean-Pierre Bemba . More about DR Congo . Bemba's lawyers argued that once the troops had crossed the border they were no longer under his command, but under the then-CAR President Ange-Felix Patasse. But the presiding judge ruled that Bemba had effective control over the troops and was therefore ""criminally responsible"". Mr Bemba led the MLC during DR Congo's brutal civil war. He is the son of a prominent businessman and a former assistant to ex-Congolese President Mobutu Sese Seko. After a peace deal in DR Congo in 2003, he laid down his arms and joined an interim government. Bemba is the most senior figure to face judgement at the court and only the third person to be convicted since the court's founding in 2002. Germain Katanga and Thomas Lubanga, both Congolese former warlords, have previously been found guilty of offences. What does this verdict mean for the ICC? This is a rare success for a beleaguered institution. It is the court's first conviction for rape as a war crime and establishes the principle that commanders are responsible for the actions of their subordinates. Why have there been so few convictions? The cases are often complex and so it takes a long time to go through the evidence. There are also logistical problems such as bringing witnesses from remote areas and organising translators. However, some cases have collapsed, most notably that of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta. Why are most of its cases in Africa? This is a question African leaders have often asked - they say the many African cases are evidence of discrimination. Critics say leaders such as Mr Kenyatta and Sudan's Omar al-Bashir have used accusations of bias as a smokescreen to evade justice. One former president, Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo, is on trial accused of war crimes. And the ICC is investigating non-African cases.

"The meeting, at Mr Putin's summer residence in Sochi, comes at a low point in bilateral relations over the war in Syria and Russia's annexation of Crimea. They are expected to discuss both issues during their meeting - but no breakthroughs are expected. Mr Putin will then meet Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday. Ties between Russia and Germany have worsened since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea in Ukraine, with Germany being a driving force behind the EU sanctions imposed in response. The pair, who are among the most powerful world leaders, have crossed paths at international summits recently. But this meeting - with the official purpose of discussing the G20 summit of world leaders to be held in Hamburg in July - is the first trip Mrs Merkel has made to Russia in two years. Mrs Merkel wants Russia to seek an end to the conflict in Ukraine by using its influence on pro-Russian separatists, and also needs Moscow's co-operation to bring peace to Syria, the BBC correspondent in Berlin, Damien McGuinness, says. But President Putin equally needs Mrs Merkel's support in to lift the EU's sanctions, our correspondent adds. Mr Putin is also keen to hear her opinion of US President Donald Trump, whom she recently met. The pair spoke frequently before the breakdown in communications since 2014, and were said to have a grudging respect for one another. She speaks Russian, having grown up in communist East Germany, and he speaks German, from his years working for the KGB in Dresden in the 1980s. Russian news outlet Tass said the pair would discuss terrorism, the Middle East, and the Minsk agreements on the Ukraine crisis, quoting a Kremlin press source. But both sides have downplayed the prospect of major breakthroughs during their meeting in Sochi. Germany remains critical of Russia's actions in Crimea in 2014, and the two leaders stand opposed on the war in Syria. The German domestic intelligence agency has also accused Russia of being behind a series of cyber attacks on state computer systems. In contrast, Mr Putin's scheduled meeting with the Turkish president the following day comes at a time of increased co-operation between the two nations. While they back opposing sides in Syria's civil war - with Moscow supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Ankara his opponents - the two countries began carrying out joint air strikes against the so-called Islamic State in January. The joint operation came a little over a year after Turkey shot down a Russian military jet, resulting in a crisis in bilateral relations.

"Forestry officials say a survey, using hidden cameras, counted 106 tigers in the wild on the Bangladeshi side of the world's largest mangrove swamp, and about 74 on the Indian side. The figures mark a sharp decline from the 440 animals recorded 10 years ago. Experts say the decline is mainly down to rampant poaching. But they add that lower numbers also reflect more accurate surveying techniques. All previous surveys counted tiger paw prints - which are unique to each animal, but difficult to spot, collate and analyse. The hidden cameras yielded lower - but more accurate figures, they say. Experts say the gangs killing the tigers trade in tiger skin and body parts.

"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK may want to be more ""obliging"" to certain countries to secure future commercial advantages. The EU is keen to maintain a united front and conduct central negotiations. Meanwhile, a leading candidate to be France's next President says he will take a ""pretty tough"" line on Brexit. Emmanuel Macron, who opinion polls suggest could win May's election, told Channel 4 News the UK should not be punished for voting to leave the EU but the EU's interests had to be paramount into the upcoming negotiations. ""We have to preserve the rest of the European Union and not to convey the message that you can decide to leave without any consequence,"" he said. Official discussions on the terms of the UK's exit and its future relationship with the EU are expected to begin in the Spring once the UK has triggered Article 50 - notifying the union of its intention to leave. Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear that the UK will leave the EU's single market and wants bespoke commercial and customs agreements based on tariff-free and ""frictionless"" cross-border trade. She has also made clear that she is prepared to leave the EU without a formal deal rather sign up to a bad one. The final agreement on the UK's exit will need the approval of 20 out of the EU's 27 other member states as well as the support of the European Parliament. However, a future trade deal could need the backing of all EU states. There have been suggestions the UK could potentially exploit divisions within the EU over how hard a bargain they are willing to drive. Several EU leaders have insisted the UK cannot expect a better deal outside the EU than it has now and their priority is to protect the interests of the remaining 27 members. Others have advised against ""punishing"" the UK. Speaking after holding talks with Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, Mr Juncker said there would be no parallel negotiations and the UK would not be allowed to conduct bilateral discussions in key areas such as finance, telecommunications or chemicals. ""A situation could arise whereby the UK might attempt to or wish to be obliging to certain member states in certain economic zones and certain sectors whereby those countries might wish to provide certain advantages to the UK,"" he said. ""It is in our interests therefore that we don't have any special discussions... with certain individual countries."" Mr Kern said that Europe would not ""capitulate"" to the UK by granting it a better status than it would enjoy if it was still an EU member. ""If you want to be a member of a club you have better conditions, obviously, than if you want to be outside the club,"" he said. The EU's negotiating team will be headed up by former commissioner Michel Barnier. Speaking during a visit to Finland his UK counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, said he wanted an outcome which was good for the EU as well as the UK. ""We're not talking about a break-up, we're talking about a new relationship, that's what we want to see,"" he said. The UK's former ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has said the negotiations - which are scheduled to be completed in two years - will be ""humungous"" in scope.

Unbeaten in 21 professional fights, Yafai previously held the Commonwealth and British super-flyweight belts. The Birmingham fighter also won a silver medal at the 2010 European Championships during his amateur career. ""It's unbelievable, it's going to take a while to sink in,"" he said.

The fight was part of a packed undercard as Britain's Anthony Joshua retained his IBF world heavyweight championship by knocking out American Eric Molina. Bury's Scott Quigg won his first fight since losing to Carl Frampton in February, and his first as a featherweight, outpointing Mexico's Jose Cayetano. Former super-bantamweight world champion Quigg, 28, had his jaw broken by Frampton but showed no signs of frailty on his return to the ring. Cayetano, himself fighting at 126lb for the first time, was unmoved by most of his opponent's punches until the end of the eighth round, when he began to wilt. And Quigg finished his rival off with a flashing left-right combination at close quarters, the referee calling a halt to proceedings with Cayetano on the deck. Quigg has plenty of options at featherweight. Frampton moved up and claimed the WBA featherweight title in July, Welshman Lee Selby is the IBF title-holder and Leeds' Josh Warrington is also in the hunt for a world title. Liverpool's Callum Smith stayed on course for a world title shot with a brutal 10th-round knockout of game Lancastrian Luke Blackledge. Referee Steve Gray could have stopped the fight earlier but allowed the one-sided battering to continue until Blackledge was knocked unconscious. There were an anxious few minutes as a prone Blackledge was administered oxygen before he gingerly, and mercifully, made it back to his feet. Smith, 26, successfully defended his British title for the first time and remained unbeaten in 22 pro fights, with 17 knockouts. He is ranked number one by the WBC but Sweden's Badou Jack is defending that belt against Britain's IBF champion James DeGale in January. In a thrilling light-heavyweight contest, Frank Buglioni stopped Hosea Burton in the 12th and final round to secure the British title. Manchester's Burton, 28, built an early lead behind his jab and some ramrod right hands, and the challenger's face was a bloody mess by the middle rounds. However, the Londoner's punches started to have an effect down the stretch and Burton went down under a barrage in the 11th. Midway through the 12th, Burton was stunned by a right to the temple before going down again. He clambered to his feet but the referee called things off after another assault by Buglioni, with a minute and four seconds remaining. Buglioni, 27, improves to 19 wins (15 KOs) and two defeats from 22 pro fights and could be rewarded with a second shot at a world title.

"Police say 540,000 people rallied in Barcelona, the capital of the region in north-east Spain, while the rest gathered in four other Catalan towns. But numbers were down sharply compared with last year's event, when 1.4 million rallied in Barcelona alone. Spain has consistently blocked attempts to hold a referendum on secession. Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont had urged support for ""converting Catalonia into an independent state"". Divisions have also emerged between the separatist movement's main political grouping in the Catalan parliament, the Together for Yes coalition, and its radical leftwing ally, the CUP. Mr Puigdemont, who took power in January, faces a confidence vote on 28 September. He advocates a negotiated withdrawal from Spain. When Catalan nationalists held an unofficial referendum on independence in November 2014, 80% of those who voted backed independence. Sunday is the ""Diada"", Catalonia's national day. It commemorates the moment in 1714 when Barcelona fell to troops loyal to Spain's King Philip V during the War of the Spanish Succession. ""We have to move towards the final outcome,"" 58-year-old office clerk Xavier Borras, who planned to attend the rally in Barcelona with a friend, told AFP news agency. ""We can't wait any longer.""

"Jamie Robinson, a medical researcher, told the BBC's World Have Your Say programme that passengers were abandoned by the staff, who ran and locked themselves away in a service room. His experience tallies with that of French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade, who described being backed up against the metal door, and getting no response to passengers' desperate calls for help. The drama unfolded on board a high-speed train travelling from Amsterdam to Paris on Friday. Mr Robinson realised something was wrong shortly after the Thalys train went through Brussels. He saw three members of the train's staff run through his coach, carriage 11, which was the next compartment along from carriage 12, where the gunman emerged. ""They said nothing. They were a man followed by two women,"" he says. ""They looked scared, they didn't alert us to anything, they ran to the end of my carriage and used their key to open a service door. Then they locked the door after them."" Carriage 11 was in the front half of the train and the locked door allowed staff access to a service area, which was off limits to passengers. Then other people started running through from carriage 12. Some were covered in blood, others said they had seen a man with a gun shooting people. ""There we were, with nowhere to go. There were probably 20 to 30 of of us, including the French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade and his family. We didn't know anything."" Anglade, who injured his hand as he tried to activate the train's alarm, has also spoken about members of train staff locking themselves in a private cabin, complaining that they could have led passengers to a luggage area in another part of the train. He told Paris Match (in French) ""We shouted for the staff to let us in, we yelled 'open!' There was no response."" Agnes Ogier, the boss of Thalys, has said there will be an internal investigation and the staff involved will be asked to ""explain their behaviour during this dramatic event"". Jamie Robinson says after 10 terrifying minutes a man entered their carriage and explained there had been a man with a gun but the situation was now under control. Afterwards he learned this was Anthony Sadler, one of the American passengers who helped overpower the attacker. ""The relief just exploded. We were all in such painful shock,"" he recalls. After learning they were safe Jamie Robinson and other passengers in his coach remained where they were, in numb silence, until they reached Arras station where the suspect, Ayoub El-Khazzani, a 25-year-old Moroccan, was arrested. Four days on from the traumatic events, Mr Robinson still can't understand why the train staff did nothing to help the passengers. He even believes the three staff may have jumped off the train as it slowly moved into Arras station. ""They must have some responsibility, not to attack the attacker but some training to alert passengers. There was nothing. They got out, they saved themselves. They locked us in that compartment."" He says he will never be able to forget the heroic actions of those who tackled the gunman. ""My life was in their hands.

"It is one of a number of measures being considered by the government in its consultation on curbing corporate pay. Other proposals include improving the effectiveness of remuneration committees and votes on pay packages. It comes after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards. The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment. Its proposals will include: . As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role. Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives. In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to Â£3.4m. As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia. A government source said: ""Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services. ""The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance. ""Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business."" The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run. She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week. Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios. The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay. A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent. It also said that pay ratios do not ""lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies"" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating ""perverse incentives"". Instead, the report argued for less complex pay structures, a ""Fair Pay Charter"" and giving shareholders more say on executive pay.","The government is considering giving employees a say on executive pay, the BBC understands.","['The source text does not indicate whether the information comes from the BBC or not.', ""The summary states that the government is considering giving employees a say on executive pay, but the source text does not mention this.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Mrs Thompson had been charged with an harassment offence but a decision was taken to discontinue her case. Mrs Thompson, of Llanwrda, said she was ""relieved"" at the news and had been worried about her impending court case, which was due to take place on Thursday. A CPS spokesman said: ""Following a review, prosecutors were no longer satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction due to insufficient evidence and therefore made the decision to discontinue the case."" Mrs Thompson became embroiled in the legal row after she was arrested in June 2011 for refusing to stop filming a council meeting for her blog, in which she was critical of the authority. She sued Mr James the following November and he successfully counter-sued in a private lawsuit.

"Joao Santana was widely seen as the architect of Ms Rousseff's 2010 and 2014 election victories. He has denied receiving bribes in a scheme to divert funds from the state-run oil company Petrobras. About 50 Brazilian politicians, including the leader of the lower house of Congress, are under investigation in the Petrobras corruption scandal. Mr Santana is accused of receiving bribes from several large engineering conglomerates. Analysts say the charge against him is a further blow for President Rousseff who is facing impeachment proceedings. He was arrested in February after he returned from the Dominican Republic, where he was working on the re-election campaign of President Danilo Medina. Because of his proximity to her, the arrest is expected to damaged her standing further, even though impeachment proceedings against her are not related to the Petrobras corruption investigation. A former journalist, Mr Santana is well known for producing dramatic, big-budget campaign videos appealing to poorer voters. Mr Santana had called the accusations ""unfounded"". And he had harsh words for the investigation, saying that Brazil was currently living in a ""climate of persecution"". If the investigating judge accepts the allegations against him, Mr Santana will be jailed.

"The former Manchester United striker, best known for his winning goal against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final, arrived with great fanfare in January 2014. He presented a different vision for Cardiff compared with the defensive approach of his predecessor Malky Mackay, renowned for an unspectacular, yet effective style that gained the club promotion to the Premier League in 2013. Mackay's success meant popularity with fans and that probably didn't help Solskjaer's cause. The Scot's bitter falling-out with the club's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan had disillusioned many supporters who saw Mackay's sacking as a regression for a club who had fought so hard for a top-flight return after half a century away. He may have promised a more exciting style, but under Solskjaer the Bluebirds slipped into the Premier League's bottom three for the first time and never recovered, finishing bottom. The results were shocking - 3-0 at Swansea, 6-3 against Liverpool, 3-0 defeats against Crystal Palace and Newcastle and 4-0 losses to Hull and Sunderland. Tan blamed Mackay for relegation, which was confirmed at the penultimate game of the season, and expected a swift Premier League return under the Norwegian. And so began a big recruitment drive in the summer. Nine players came in, many of Mackay's men left, but it seemed even with so many new faces Solskjaer didn't know what his best team was. He named a different starting 11 for all of the games he oversaw this season and his tinkering was deemed to have had an adverse effect on results. Two home defeats in succession, against Norwich and Middlesbrough, sealed his fate. The nature of the capitulation against the Canaries caused particular concern, Cardiff leading 2-0 before conceding four second-half goals to lose 4-2. During the 1-0 loss against Boro four days later, the Cardiff crowd vented their frustration at the Norwegian, booing him as he tried to get the ball to one of his players to take a throw-in. After the game the Norwegian said he accepted the blame for the club's poor run of form. ""I'm responsible and I should get better results than we've had in the first seven games,"" said Solskjaer, who seems to have the ability to remain upbeat in the most trying of circumstances. The manager may be responsible for the team but many feel the board, and particularly owner Vincent Tan, have to take some responsibility too. ""It was the wrong appointment for Cardiff and the wrong club for Solskjaer,"" said former Cardiff captain Jason Perry on BBC Radio Wales. ""Do we know how Cardiff City play? No. ""I think only four players played against Blackburn [in the Championship opener] that played against Middlesbrough. He picked a different back four yet again. ""If you're manager or a coach you have a central strategy and you work on that."" Solskjaer will not have the chance to find a strategy that works and attention now turns to the next man to work under Tan. Early favourites include Welshman Tony Pulis, who would be popular with fans given the job he did at Crystal Palace last season, and Dundee's Paul Hartley, who has overseen his club's rise to the Scottish Premiership.

"The cartoon, by prominent artist Jonathan Shapiro, known as Zapiro, also features a poem, which refers to Mr Zuma as a ""dick"". The latest row comes just weeks after the ANC forced an art gallery to withdraw a painting showing Mr Zuma with his genitals exposed. Mr Zuma is set to face Zapiro in court in October over a different cartoon. The president sued the cartoonist, who works for the Mail & Guardian newspaper, after he depicted Mr Zuma in 2008 about to rape a female figure representing justice. Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006. The pair have also clashed over Zapiro's portrayal of Mr Zuma with a shower cap on his head - a reference to Mr Zuma's statement in the rape trial that he had taken a shower after having sex to reduce the chance of contracting HIV.

""All South Africans share our disgust."" The painting in the gallery triggered a huge debate in South Africa about the freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Before the gallery agreed to remove the painting, called The Spear, it was vandalised by two men.

"Ashley Brace, from Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent, could not compete at the Commonwealth Games because of her kickboxing past. She said she was unhappy with the support from the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA). Chairman David Francis said the organisation did all it could to help. The Association of International Boxing Associations (AIBA) said Brace was ineligible to compete for Team Wales because she had competed in professional kickboxing in the past, which she denied. Organisers of the kickboxing tournaments she competed in have also since confirmed she did so on an amateur basis. A further rule states any boxer returning from another individual contact sport should apply to an international committee to become eligible to box again.

She now trains at Bristol Boxing Gym and has her first professional fight in Newport on 30 October.

"For the past six weeks or so, he has driven his green Lamborghini to the UFC's new performance institute on a daily basis. At this hub, located about four miles from the city's famous strip, you can mimic conditions at 10,000ft of altitude, clock miles on an underwater treadmill, or analyse the density of specific muscles. If an athlete is to be built rather than born, this is the place. The attention to detail is stunningly intricate and it was Manchester City's own training complex which offered key elements of the blueprint. A group of journalists are led through the $14m development by Forrest Griffin, a retired UFC light-heavyweight champion and now a vice-president with focus on athlete development. He paints details around what we see at the 30,000 square feet facility, which opened in May. Some 23 years have passed since UFC was formed but this building is seen as a game changer which will take the welfare and performance of athletes to new levels. It is far removed from the spit and sawdust gyms which shaped some of boxing's greatest names. Some 24 hours earlier, I visited the Mayweather Boxing Gym, a world-renowned facility which inside is straightforward, humble and brilliantly effective. But the UFC institute cuts with tradition in pursuit of gains. Measurability, science and mapped progress shape the mantra. Griffin explains how recovery is meticulously plotted. He points to one of his own injuries and a subsequent substantial difference in mass between his two quad muscles, detected after his retirement. A UFC fighter at the Institute would be scanned during rehabilitation to highlight which muscles have suffered during their lay-off so targeted rebuilding can be done. Any fighter competing under the UFC banner can train here at no cost. Tailored workout programmes appear on screens next to weight stations. If an athlete is only here for a short spell, their data and subsequent training plan will be sent to an app to use at their traditional base. Whatever the goal - recovery, strength, mobility, technique - there is a desire to offer a menu of ways to work on it. As Griffin stresses, what works for one individual will do nothing for another. In the recovery area, for example, athletes can opt for use of a cryotherapy chamber or laser-light therapy. Both will stimulate circulation, flushing away lactic acid and easing aches and pains. Facilities are purposely placed one room apart to ease access. We pass through a door and Griffin fires up the underwater treadmill McGregor has been filmed using in recent weeks. ""Conor has had a knee injury in the past so he doesn't like to do roadwork,"" says Griffin, 38. ""So he does a lot of bike work and he uses this as it has no impact on your body and you can work hard."" Two pools next to the underwater treadmill offer temperatures of 105F and 50F respectively to again offer variety in recovery. Griffin explains why McGregor's typical routine of sleeping in until midday makes perfect sense. ""He's been here once or twice a day for six weeks,"" adds Griffin. ""Training at the time you fight is under appreciated. When do you work out the best, after being up for 12 hours or three or four hours? He primes his body to do that, which is intelligent."" We are taken to meet UFC flyweight Joe Benevidez, who is receiving treatment from director of physical therapy Heather Linden. Linden left a role at the USA's Olympic Training Centre in Colorado Springs to be here. She jokes when explaining how even the toughest UFC fighters can struggle on a pilates ball when she isolates their weakest muscles in order to highlight where work is needed. ""What's been a shock is how little access to services these athletes have had in the past,"" she says. ""It's amazing how some of them have never had medical guidance for preventative measures. ""I've had to build trust. I had a guy come in here and tell me he couldn't feel his left arm but he was going to fight. He was scared of telling people in the event he was pulled from competing but with work we restored him to full functionality in two weeks."" Former UFC welterweight Dan Hardy is part of the tour. The Nottingham-born 35-year-old describes the facilities as ""night and day"" to what he used. ""My life would be different now,"" he tells the group. ""I used to work with friends for treatment, driving around for different things I needed."" Despite all the technology in what feels like the slickest of finishing schools, MMA critics still exist. Perhaps blighted by images of the ground and pound or blood-stained faces they question the morality of the sport. But UFC's growth shows no sign of relenting. The company was sold for $4.2bn in 2016 and listening to Griffin it is obvious this is a sport with vision. Mapping the layout of the Institute saw the UFC research facilities at the likes of Man City, the Phoenix Suns basketball team and the USA Olympic team base. Habits were observed, such as an athlete's occasional tendency to neglect post-workout nutrition if access to it was not made easy. Consequently, UFC athletes can only exit the building by passing a nutritional team. ""We learned from mistakes people had made in the past,"" adds Griffin. ""A facility and its staff may be too spread out. Manchester City have a great layout. The locker room is the centre of the building. The athletes start and end in the locker room so you build every service around that. ""Every sport taxes the human body a certain way. The needs and demands change but the impact on the body and the recovery needed is very similar."" Media playback is not supported on this device .

"But the co-founder and chief executive of UK chocolate shop chain Hotel Chocolat says he was actually inspired to set up his own business after seeing the success of his father's other company - a printing firm. Since the first Hotel Chocolat store opened in 2004 the company has gone on to grow into a multi-million pound empire, with 81 shops, eight cafes, two restaurants, and a hotel. As soon as Mr Thirlwell, 51, starts talking, there's no mistaking what drove the firm's evolution. He speaks about chocolate with such evangelical zeal he is bouncing up and down in his chair. Talking wistfully about the 18th Century, when chocolate houses were all the rage in London, Mr Thirlwell admits that his fantasy is to ""make cocoa the hero"" again - educating people to recognise and appreciate the higher cocoa content in the chocolate Hotel Chocolat produces compared to some of the best-known brands. ""We want consumers to be having the same debate about the flavours of different cocoa beans as wine,"" he says. Mr Thirlwell's desire to educate extends to leaving chocolates he thinks people should like on the shelves even when they're not selling. The firm's 100% dark chocolate products, for example, took five years to become profitable. Yet using large amounts of cocoa doesn't come cheap, and the firm's ""Signature Cabinet"", which has three drawers full of chocolates, costs a whopping £160. But Mr Thirlwell says the pricing makes sense if you look at the cost of the cocoa hit, as well as the packaging. He points out that by contrast, the firm's entry level ""Selector"" range starts from £3.75. ""It's very important to us that we're accessible,"" he adds. Such a wide-ranging pricing structure seems to work with customers, as the company enjoyed sales of £70m in the year to the end of June 2013. And it is continuing to expand apace. Hotel Chocolat's rapid development has been helped by the creation of innovative chocolate bonds, through which it has raised around £5m from investors, to whom it pays ""interest"" in chocolate. Mr Thirlwell picked up the business bug working for his father's printing firm in his school holidays. He says it gave him a strong sense that running a company was ""exciting"". Nonetheless, he ""didn't have a clue"" what he wanted to do with life until he got a job at a French hi-tech firm as part of his French and economics degree. The lure of business was so strong, he dropped out of his course altogether, staying on in France to help the company export its products. It was on his return to the UK that Mr Thirlwell met Hotel Chocolat's co-founder Peter Harris, who interviewed him for a sales and marketing job at another tech firm. They hit it off so well that just 10 months later, they left together and in 1987 set up Hotel Chocolat's forerunner - The Mint Marketing Company (MMC), which sold packaged mints branded with company logos. Mr Thirlwell got the idea for the business after his father told him that the most successful promotion the printing company had been involved with was for such a product. To fund MMC Mr Thirlwell and Mr Harris both took out £5,000 personal loans. Unfortunately, the wrapping machine they'd bought didn't work, and they had to hand wrap 20,000 packs to make their first order. Mr Thirlwell admits many people would have seen this as a sign that it wasn't meant to be, but he says that this is ""rubbish"". ""Lots of businesses have some early setbacks,"" he says. ""You've just got to overcome them somehow. ""These things happen all the time even when you're established. You just swat them away more easily."" MMC evolved into Choc Express when their customers asked if they had anything beyond mints, and they started selling chocolates online in 1993, becoming one of the UK's earliest e-retailers. Then in 2004 they opened their first store in Watford, after changing the name of the business to Hotel Chocolat. But why would a retail business wish to call itself a hotel? Mr Thirlwell says: ""It was aspirational. I was trying to come up with something that expressed the power that chocolate has to lift you out of your current mood and take you to a better place."" ""Everyone agreed 'chocolat' sounded better than chocolate. It's almost onomatopoeia, and suggests how the chocolate melts in your mouth."" A decade later, the business does own a hotel, which it built in Saint Lucia beside its own cocoa plantation, which provides some of the cocoa for its chocolates. The company also now has two restaurants, one in London and one in Leeds, serving sweet and savoury dishes that include cocoa. Plus it has stores in Copenhagen. And from originally outsourcing production of its chocolates, Hotel Chocolat now makes them all itself at its own factory in Cambridgeshire. Despite Hotel Chocolat's expansion, not a single part of the range gets onto the shelves without first being approved by Mr Thirlwell. He chairs a tasting session every Wednesday, where they try new recipes and combinations, and calls this the ""triage"" of the brand quality. ""It's the beginning of the product, so if I let anything past there that I'm not happy with - it could affect the brand."" Customers can also get in on the act via the firm's Tasting Club - a monthly box of new chocolates which members test and score. The club now has 100,000 members who have given the business a vast range of data on the public's tastes. A chocolate containing thyme oil has so far scored worst, generating ""sackfuls of mail"". ""But if you get bull's-eyes for all of them you almost think you're not pushing the boundaries enough,"" says Mr Thirlwell. He admits pushing boundaries is also part of ""future proofing"" the business. ""If you're specialist you've got to be absolutely specialist. There's a lot of competition and we want to be in the driving seat.""","When Simon Thirlwell was growing up in south-west London, his father ran a chocolate factory.","['The source text does not include his first name ""Simon.""

"The 25-year-old Catholic constable died when a bomb exploded under his car in Omagh on Saturday. A number of dignitaries including NI First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness are at the requiem mass. Members of his Gaelic football club joined his police colleagues in a highly symbolic guard of honour. 'Appalling' No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but dissident republicans have been blamed. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Wednesday morning, Irish prime minister Enda Kenny strongly condemned the attack. ""To those who think they are doing something for Ireland, this is a warped mentality,"" he said. ""It is the mentality of the past, a very dark and violent past and it has no part in the future."" He said Constable Kerr had been in the ""prime of life"" and it was ""appalling"" for his life to be taken from him. ""It does nothing for any community in this country,"" he added. The Gaelic Athletic Association administers a number of sports including Gaelic football and hurling which are among the most popular in Ireland. Unprecedented . Its joint involvement with the PSNI in the funeral service is unprecedented and has been described as highly symbolic. The GAA previously banned the security forces from being members but this rule was lifted after the PSNI was formed out of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 2001. Dissident republicans remain opposed to the police and have repeatedly targeted officers in both gun and bomb attacks. Last year, Peadar Heffron, who captained the PSNI Gaelic football team, had a leg amputated after a similar booby-trap attack on his car. Constable Kerr was a member of the Beragh Red Knights GAA club. Its chairman Gerard Treacy said it was right that the GAA and the PSNI should ""show solidarity with one another"" at the funeral. ""Our community has been attacked and so the community of the PSNI been attacked and today shoulder to shoulder we will stand together in solidarity and show the people of Ireland and the world that this sort of despicable action is not going to be tolerated,"" he said. 'Overwhelming' messages . NI Secretary Owen Paterson is representing the British Government at the funeral. It is also being attended by Irish opposition leader Micheal Martin, the Ulster Unionist Party leader Tom Elliott and several NI church leaders. PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott and his counterpart from the Irish police Martin Callinan are also present. Catholic primate Cardinal Sean Brady is leading the funeral mass and Father John Skinnader, a cousin of Ronan's mother Nuala, is giving the homily. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has organised a lunchtime rally in Belfast on Wednesday to allow people to express their abhorrence at the killing. Books of condolence have been opened across Northern Ireland, while on its Facebook page the PSNI said it had been ""overwhelmed by messages of sympathy and support"". On Tuesday, the Crimestoppers charity offered a Â£50,000 reward for information leading to those responsible for the murder. Constable Kerr, who joined the police in May 2010, is the second officer to have been killed since the Royal Ulster Constabulary became the PSNI in 2001. Constable Stephen Carroll was shot dead in a gun attack in Craigavon in March 2009. Constable Kerr is survived by his mother, Nuala, a widow, two brothers, Cathair and Aaron and a sister, Dairine. 1.

"It was unanimously passed by MPs in December, but Mr Koroma refused to sign it after protests by religious leaders. After consultations, MPs returned the bill to him last month, unaltered. The law would allow women to terminate a pregnancy in any circumstances up to 12 weeks and in cases of incest, rape and foetal impairment up to 24 weeks. Abortion is currently illegal in Sierra Leone under any circumstances. Human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and five Sierra Leonean organisations, wrote to President Koroma in February urging him to give the bill his assent. ""Unsafe abortions - often resulting from restrictive laws and poor access to sexual and reproductive health services, information, and education - is one of the main factors contributing to maternal deaths in Sierra Leone,"" their letter said. The World Health Organization estimates that Sierra Leone has the world's highest maternal mortality ratio at 1,360 deaths per 100,000 live births last year. The BBC's Umaru Fofana in the capital, Freetown, says the abortion issue has led to heated debates and protests on both sides. President Koroma has now referred the controversial legislation to the Constitutional Review Committee, which is currently reviewing the constitution. Our correspondent says it will decide whether to include the abortion law in its recommended changes to the constitution, which will be put to a referendum. When President Koroma sent the legislation back to parliament in January, he asked for it to be reviewed after consultation with religious and women's groups as it went beyond an African Union protocol on women's rights which only backs abortion in cases of sexual assault and in medical emergencies. Under Sierra Leone's current constitution, the president cannot veto a bill which received a two-thirds majority in parliament, our reporter says. The speaker of the house could sign the Safe Abortion Act into law, but our correspondent says he is highly unlikely to do so as he comes from the president's party. Mr Koroma met leaders from the Inter Religious Council of Sierra Leone (IRCSL), who all oppose abortion, in January, saying they ""represent a huge constituency across the country"". Catholic Archbishop Tamba Charles, vice-president of IRCSL, reiterated their view at summit on the issue later in the month declaring: ""No life can be destroyed on the basis of choice as life is sacred. ""If they want to fight for the right of women, then let them be provided with the required medical facilities that will help reduce maternal mortality rate in the country,"" Sierra Leone's Politico news website quotes him as saying.

Aaron Hughes half-cleared a corner as far as Nordtveit, whose shot beat Camp via the unfortunate Clingan. Grant McCann, a half-time substitute, had a decent crack at goal soon after the break with his 25-yard drive being tipped away by Jarstein. Paddy McCourt came on with just over 20 minutes to go, replacing Shane Ferguson. The Celtic man was watched from the stands by club boss Neil Lennon, returning to the ground where he was once barracked by his own fans on international duty. David Healy then came on as a substitute to become Northern Ireland's most capped outfield player on 92, passing Mal Donaghy. Elyounoussi extended the visitors' lead three minutes from time when he beat Camp at the near post with a fine shot. Ruud's superb injury-time volley made it 3-0 despite the Nottingham Forest keeper getting a strong hand to it. Northern Ireland: Camp, McAuley, Hughes, Jonathan Evans, McGivern, Corry Evans, Clingan, Davis, Ferguson, Shiels, Paterson.

"Speaking to reporters, FBI boss James Comey said the plans to enable encryption by default could thwart law enforcement investigations. Lives could depend on police forces continuing to get access to the data on devices used by criminals and terrorists, he said. The FBI was talking to both Apple and Google about its fears, said Mr Comey. The conversations with tech firms needed to be had before the day when police forces lost access to those devices, he said. ""I'd hate to have people look at me and say, 'Well how come you can't save this kid?' 'How come you can't do this thing?'"" said Mr Comey in a briefing. His comments came in reaction to a decision by Apple to enable a file encryption system on its iOS 8 software for which it has no keys. This means it would not be able to comply with any official request to help police get at the data on those devices. Google has said it too is planning to enable a similar encryption system by default on the next version of Android. Mr Comey said he was ""very concerned"" about these plans because of what they would allow people to do. ""What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law,"" he said. ""I am a huge believer in the rule of law, but I am also a believer that no-one in this country is beyond the law,"" he added. Apple and Google have yet to respond to Mr Comey's comments. Ten days prior to Mr Comey's press statement, iOS data forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski pointed out that Apple's encryption system would not stop police getting at data on portable devices. Specifically weakening security systems just to aid the police was a bad decision, he said. ""For the sake of privacy and overall security, the only logical solution is to make products as secure as possible, and let good detective work do the crime solving, rather than an easy button,"" he wrote in a blogpost.","The FBI has said it is ""very concerned"" about plans by Apple and Google to weaken security on mobile devices.","['The FBI is concerned with Apple and Google strengthening security, not weakening it.

"Alex Gray, from Perth in Tayside, is awaiting sentence after being convicted earlier this month of burglary and harassment. The singer said she was not angry with Gray and claimed ""the system has failed him"", a view echoed by his mother. The 30-year-old started pursuing the star by sending abusive rants and accusations in letters. He progressed to banging on her door and spending nights in her back garden. Gray was eventually charged by police after an incident last October when the singer was awoken by him bursting into her bedroom in the early hours. Allen said she was made to feel like a ""nuisance rather than a victim"" by police, adding that the experience had left her ""a changed person"". Gray's mother Michelle said she had tried to get help for her son from the authorities for years. Speaking on the Good Morning Britain programme, she said: ""I had no idea that he had been stalking Lily Allen and putting her through these years of torture. ""We knew he had a fixation with her but not that he had actually been anywhere near her. ""We just thought he had a fantasy in his head."" What's the difference between a super-fan and a stalker? It's not the first time a celebrity has received obsessive attention, but what are the stages that lead to somebody becoming a dangerous stalker? Lily Allen was relaxing in her flat last year when a stalker broke in and confronted her in her bedroom. ""I'm lying in bed and I can see the door handle moving and then he steams in, starts screaming and shouting... I could see he was really agitated and upset,"" she told the BBC's Newsnight. Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing. It was the culmination of an ordeal that started back in 2008 when Gray first contacted Allen on Twitter. Over time he began turning up at her house and office, left abusive notes and made suicide threats. READ MORE . She added: ""We knew he had a mental disorder and he had been diagnosed with paranoid delusional schizophrenia two years ago and he was meant to be on medication for this, but nobody was ensuring that that was happening. ""It escalated after his dad died. He got worse and we knew he was getting worse. We tried to get him help and nobody would help us at all."" His sister Kaylie Gray said: ""I don't think it's going to be good for either party - for Alex, for us, for her (Allen) - if he just goes to prison because he's not going to get any help. ""He's just going to continue to get worse and then he's going to get released without any help and we are just back to square one again."" Asked if Gray had shown any remorse, his sister replied: ""No, Alex is a very closed book. ""He doesn't like to talk about anything and because of his disorder he thinks people are tapping phones, so he won't talk to me about things like that over the phone."" His mother added: ""He finds it hard to... separate what's real and what's not real, it's part of his illness, I think."" Kaylie Gray said the family has not had any contact with Lily Allen. She added: ""We are really sorry that it got this far. It's horrendous what her and her family have had to go through and obviously we feel so horrible for her."" In an interview with The Observer, Allen said: ""Until he gets the right treatment and the right help he needs, then I'm not safe. ""You can throw the book at him, put him in jail, but he'll still be coming out. And the victim is never safe.""

"The claim: Membership of the European Union guarantees rights on equal pay, sexual harassment and maternity leave, and rights for part-time workers. Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave. Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure ""that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work"". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work. Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination. If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked. However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law. Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape.

"The move would also ease the ""growing burden"" on politicians in Cardiff Bay as more power is devolved, the group's Wales director Martin Warren said. Peers serving in the UK cabinet have set the precedent, he added. Parties in the assembly have questioned the idea on the grounds of democracy and accountability. The accountants' organisation said scrutiny of Welsh legislation was suffering due to ""significant workloads for politicians shifting from Westminster to Cardiff Bay"". If it proved difficult to increase the number of AMs from the present 60, a bigger role could be given to the 40 MPs from Wales as their role in Parliament diminished, Mr Warren said. He suggested letting the first minister appoint MPs to the Welsh cabinet, or inviting MPs to serve on assembly committees, in both cases reducing the demands on the time of politicians in Cardiff Bay. Another idea put forward was the creation of a non-political body of professionals who could advise on and scrutinise policy. ""Wales is a small country with limited resources and making best use of those resources within a democratic framework to achieve for Wales must surely be an objective that crosses all political borders,"" said Mr Warren. Dr Rebecca Rumbul, politics lecturer at the Centre for Lifelong Learning at Cardiff University, said involving MPs in assembly business might be ""confusing"" to voters. Liberal Democrat AM Peter Black was also doubtful, claiming MPs ""won't be able to do either job properly"". Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""After 17 years of the same old, tired ideas in a Labour-run Wales, our country needs a change. ""May's election is the chance to choose the Welsh Conservatives and secure new ministers, fresh ideas and a brighter future."" For Plaid Cymru, former presiding officer Lord Elis-Thomas said it was ""a completely anti-democratic idea"". ""The notion that people could come down to Cardiff, turn up and be ministers without having been elected takes us back to a pre-democratic period, and certainly before the assembly was in existence,"" he told BBC Radio Cymru. ""If anyone is suggesting something like this, we'd need to have a referendum immediately.""

"The actor was charged with culpable homicide in Mumbai for the September 2002 incident. Mr Khan has always denied he was at the wheel. If convicted, he faces 10 years in prison. Mr Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars and has starred in more than 80 Hindi-language films. Several of his films, including Dabangg, Ready, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aap Ke Hain Kaun, have been huge commercial hits. Late on the night of 28 September 2002, his Toyota Land Cruiser hit the American Express bakery in the Bandra area of Mumbai, authorities say. The vehicle ran over five people sleeping on the street, killing 38-year-old Noor Ullah Khan and seriously injuring three others. Another person received minor injuries. The prosecution has alleged that Mr Khan was driving the car and that he was drunk. In March the actor told the court he was not drunk and was not driving the car. But many witnesses have said that was not the case. A constable attached to Mr Khan's security said in a statement to the police that the ""drunk"" actor had lost control of the car. The policeman died in 2007 of tuberculosis. In April, Mr Khan's driver told the court that he had crashed the car after a tyre burst. At the scene, Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Mumbai . It's not uncommon most days to find people camped outside the house of Salman Khan hoping for a glimpse of the star.

"Five Saudis, reportedly including a prince, were detained at Beirut's airport after two tonnes of pills branded as Captagon were found in cases due to be loaded onto a private jet. It was the largest drug smuggling operation yet uncovered at the airport. Captagon pills, which typically contain amphetamine and caffeine, are consumed widely in the Middle East. The drug has helped fuel the conflict in Syria, generating millions of dollars in revenue for producers inside the country as well as being used by combatants to help them keep fighting. NNA reported that 40 bags of Captagon pills were found by inspectors from the Gendarmerie in cases due to be put on board a jet bound for Hael, in northern Saudi Arabia. It did not identify the Saudi citizens who were detained, but sources told the Associated Press and the AFP news agency that they included a Saudi prince. In April 2014, Lebanese security forces foiled an attempt to smuggle 15 million Captagon pills hidden in shipping containers full of corn from Beirut's seaport, according to AFP. Captagon, originally the trade name for the synthetic stimulant fenetylline, was first produced in the 1960s to treat hyperactivity, narcolepsy and depression. However, it was banned in most countries by the 1980s because of it was too addictive. In 2013, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said 64% of global seizures of amphetamine took place in the Middle East, and that most of the amphetamine was in the form of Captagon pills.","Lebanese police have foiled an attempt to smuggle millions of dollars worth of a banned drug into the country, the National News Agency (NNA) reports.","['The summary makes up the value of the police seizure', 'The summary states that the smuggling attempt was to bring drugs into the country, but the text describes an attempt to smuggle drugs out of the country.', 'The summary states that Lebanese police foiled the smuggling attempt, but the text attributes the discovery to inspectors from the Gendarmerie, not the police.

"Hamilton's Mercedes was 0.264 seconds quicker than Vettel, with Rosberg 0.035secs further adrift.

McLaren's Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button were in unexpectedly high 13th and 14th places as others struggled. Like McLaren, Red Bull and Toro Rosso will take penalties for using more than their permitted number of engines and it remains to be seen in which order these will leave the six drivers at the back of the grid. Qualifying gets under way at 13:00 BST, with coverage on the BBC Sport website from 11:30 and on BBC Radio 5 live from 13:00. There seems little doubt about who will be at the front after another imperious performance from Hamilton. The world champion has looked untouchable so far this weekend and seems an almost certain bet for his 11th pole in 12 races this season. Media playback is not supported on this device . After Friday practice, Rosberg admitted his team-mate had the edge and that he needed to work out how to match the Briton's pace through the final two corners at Ascari and Parabolica. The German actually set the fastest time in the final part of the lap, which comprises the two demanding fast corners, but Hamilton edged him this time in the two chicanes and the Lesmo corners and remained tantalisingly out of reach. Instead, Rosberg was surprisingly beaten by his compatriot Vettel, who showed an improvement in form after a difficult Friday as Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne was joined by Piero Ferrari - the son of founder Enzo - watching from the Ferrari garage. Whether the red cars can maintain that pace once Mercedes turn up their engines for qualifying remains a different question. Ferrari face stiff opposition from the Mercedes customer teams - Force India, Williams and Lotus for places behind the world champions at the front of the grid. The prospects for two grand former champions, Red Bull and McLaren, are rather grimmer. Both teams have engine partners in Renault and Honda who are failing in their struggle to match Mercedes, falling short in both reliability and performance. Media playback is not supported on this device . And both - as well as fellow Renault customer Toro Rosso, the Red Bull junior team - are taking penalties for changing engine parts. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was using a brand new engine that would add to the 25 grid positions worth of penalties he had already accrued, but that failed in the course of the session, team boss Christian Horner saying the problem was ""terminal"". Earlier, Horner attempted to make a joke of the situation, saying the competition for who can take the most penalties was closer than that at the front of the grid. Renault denied Horner's claim that a development engine might not appear this year. Horner said if it did appear it would be worth only 0.15secs a lap.

"Brian Krebs says the administrator of a Russian cybercrime forum hatched a plan to order heroin, arranged for it to be delivered to his home, then tipped off the police, making it look as if the call had come from a neighbour's house. Fortunately, Mr Krebs was already monitoring the website and saw the plot being planned in real time. He alerted the FBI and local police. ""I am little concerned"", he told the BBC. ""But then there are a lot of things people can do to upset you and get under your skin using a keyboard and few clicks of a mouse. ""But what's the next level?"" The person behind the attempted plot, according to Mr Krebs, set up a bitcoin wallet to accept donations of the digital currency from fellow forum members. He raised about $200 (Â£131) worth of bitcoins and used it to buy 12 small bags of heroin using the Silk Road online black market. The package duly arrived at Mr Krebs's house, and he handed it over to the police. This is just the latest example of a sustained smear campaign against Mr Krebs orchestrated by hackers and cybercriminals disgruntled at his exposure of their antics. In March he was visited by a heavily armed police unit tricked into responding to a 911 call that had been made to look as if it originated from his home. Mr Krebs says he opened the front door to find a squad of policemen pointing a battery of guns at him. After being hand-cuffed and questioned, he managed to persuade the police they had been hoaxed by hackers. The informant had used a instant message relay service designed for hearing impaired and deaf people to pretend to be Mr Krebs reporting that Russians had broken into his home and shot his wife. The phenomenon, known as swatting, after the special weapons and tactics (Swat) teams called out to handle hostage and other dangerous situations, had begun on the West Coast, the police told Mr Krebs, but had been working its way eastwards.

"It wants to redress the balance from the university's walls being lined with pictures of ""dead white males"" by adding more women and ethnic minorities. The portraits include broadcasters Dame Esther Rantzen and Reeta Chakrabarti. Oxford's head of equality Trudy Coe said it was ""sending a signal"". This commissioning of portraits is one of the biggest projects by the university to create a more diverse range of people portrayed in its public places - including more women, people from ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians and people with disabilities. The university faced a high-profile controversy last year over whether a statue of Cecil Rhodes should be removed - after claims that the Victorian colonialist's attitudes on race made him an unsuitable figure to be commemorated. The new pictures on the ancient walls will include scientist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and author Jeanette Winterson. There will also be some men, including film maker Ken Loach. ""We're not taking anyone down - but the portraits have been almost exclusively men and we're just beginning to redress the balance,"" says Ms Coe, head of the university's equality and diversity unit. ""It will allow students to look up and see people who look like them. It's sending a signal to a wider range of students that they belong here,"" she says. Ms Coe says the new pictures will reflect the modern reality of university life - and the people who have been painted or photographed have been nominated by current staff and students. The people depicted have links with the university - such as being former students or academic staff - with the criteria that they were examples of excellence and widened the range of pictures from the ""narrow and traditional"" and ""challenged stereotypes"". Among the people to be represented will be criminologist and disability rights campaigner, Marie Tidball. ""Symbols are important,"" she said. There are millions of people with a disability in the UK, Ms Tidball said, but they have a ""lack of visibility in public spaces"". The commissioning of a picture of an academic with a disability was a ""very significant"" step towards making sure that all kinds of students could feel at home at the university, she said.

Motor neurone disease (MND) campaigner Gordon Aikman is awarded the British Empire Medal. John Muir, who has campaigned against knife crime following the murder of his son, receives an MBE. And Edinburgh-born broadcaster Nicky Campbell has been given an OBE for services to children. Campbell, a regular on TV and radio for years, has spoken openly about his experience of being adopted and is a patron of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF). Dr MacMillan, who wrote a new choral piece which was sung when Pope Benedict XVI conducted mass at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow in 2010, is being knighted for services to music. His compositions are widely played around the world by performers ranging from top international orchestras to local church and community choirs. Dr MacMillan said: ""I am totally delighted to receive this honour. I am especially pleased that the world of music, and contemporary composition in particular, will receive greater focus and recognition as a result."" The 55-year-old composer, who was born in Kilwinning in North Ayrshire, has previously described the high point of his career as ""writing a piece for the unveiling of a statue of the founder of Celtic FC"". Mr Aikman, 30, from Edinburgh, is being awarded the British Empire Medal after raising Â£300,000 to raise awareness of MND, which he was diagnosed with last year.

""I want to share this honour with each and every one of my fellow fighters."" Aileen Paterson, the creator of Maisie the kitten, is also among those to receive an honour. The author, who penned the much-loved series of books about adventures of a cat from Edinburgh's Morningside, is being awarded with an MBE for services to children's literature. The same honour has been awarded to campaigner John Muir, who led demands for tougher sentences for knife crime after his son Damian was stabbed to death in the centre of Greenock in 2007. From the sporting world, Peter Dawson, the chief executive of The R&A and secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, is recognised with an OBE. Mr Dawson will step down in September after 16 years leading the body which organises the Open Championship. Iain McMillan, who was the director of the CBI in Scotland for almost two decades, is to be knighted for his services to the economy north of the border. The same honour goes to Prof Pete Downes, who has been the principal and vice-chancellor of Dundee University since 2009, in recognition of his work in higher education and life sciences. Prof Downes is one of the UK's most distinguished and cited bioscientists, and identified the role of the drug Lithium in treating manic depression. Dr Lena Wilson, the chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, the national economic development agency, is recognised for her efforts with a CBE. As part of her role, she has travelled to more than 60 countries across the world, promoting Scottish business interests and advising governments on foreign investment and private sector development. Lynne McNicoll, who has raised more than Â£1m to support children with cancer and their families, will be presented with an OBE. Her fundraising activities inspired her to set up the Edinburgh-based charity It's Good 2 Give five years ago, and she has continued to raise funds despite being diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year. The charity is currently raising funds to build a special centre where youngsters with cancer and their families can go for breaks of up to seven days.

"The hour-long session featured questions on Brexit, steel, devolution and the Severn crossings. Committee chair David Davies, who voted for Britain to leave the EU, opened with this question: ""May I begin by asking what you think are the potential advantages to Wales of Brexit?"" Mr Cairns, who campaigned for Britain to remain, gave this hesitant reply: ""Well there are certainly lots of challenges. The advantages are that we are almost forced to look elsewhere other than Europe and we need to remember we're not turning our backs on Europe, we're just merely leaving the European Union and nations across Europe will still remain friends and allies. ""The advantages are that we will need to focus our efforts on seeking new international trade opportunities and in developing relationships between Welsh business and Welsh stakeholders with those new markets.

Questioned about devolution, he said there are no changes planned to the Wales Bill other than those he has previously signalled at committee stage.

Mr Cairns said every debate had finished with time to spare. Asked about the dropping of the commitment to hold a referendum before Wales gets income tax powers, he told the MPs: ""Tax is an absolutely essential part of devolution policy."" He added: This is about mature, accountable devolution."" He said he intended to have a fiscal framework agreed with the Welsh Government before the Wales Bill becomes law. Asked about funding, he said: ""There are no plans to change the Barnett Formula."" He said the funding floor introduced by the government meant funding per head was set at around 115 % of the English average. On the steel industry, Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said that there were some concerns about the possible joint venture of ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel Europe. Mr Cairns said: ""ThyssenKrupp are prepared to invest significant sums of money into a joint venture scheme with the offer of support from the UK government, and that in itself we can take encouragement from because that shows they're prepared to spend money."" He said taxpayers' money would only be used if there was a viable sustainable future in steelmaking.

"Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) led the international investigation. Security sources have told the BBC that the NCSC believes that a hacking group known as Lazarus launched the attack. The US Computer Emergency Response Team has also warned about Lazarus. The same group is believed to have targeted Sony Pictures in 2014. The Sony hack came as the company planned to release the movie The Interview, a satire about the North Korean leadership starring Seth Rogen. The movie was eventually given a limited release after an initial delay. The same group is also thought to have been behind the theft of money from banks. In May, ransomware called WannaCry swept across the world, locking computers and demanding payment for them to be unlocked. The NHS in the UK was particularly badly hit. Officials in Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) began their own investigation and concluded their assessment in recent weeks. The ransomware did not target Britain or the NHS specifically, and may well have been a money-making scheme that got out of control, particularly since the hackers do not appear to have retrieved any of the ransom money as yet. Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear. Private sector cyber-security researchers around the world began picking apart the code to try to understand who was behind the attack soon after. Adrian Nish, who leads the cyber threat intelligence team at BAE Systems, saw overlaps with previous code developed by the Lazarus group. ""It seems to tie back to the same code-base and the same authors,"" Nish says. ""The code-overlaps are significant."" Private sector cyber security researchers reverse engineered the code but the British assessment by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - is likely to have been made based on a wider set of sources. America's NSA has also more recently made the link to North Korea but its assessment is not thought to have been based on as deep as an investigation as the UK, partly because the US was not hit as hard by the incident. Officials say they have not seen any significant evidence supporting other possible culprits. North Korean hackers have been linked to money-making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. ""It was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,"" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say they saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. Its spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a ""kill switch"" to slow it down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but they may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind it. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK-based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say they have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to them. Those behind the attack may not have expected it to have spread as fast as it did. Once they realised that their behaviour was drawing global attention, the risks of moving the money may have been seen as too high given the relatively small amount involved, leaving them with little to show for their work. The revelation of the link to North Korea will raise difficult questions about what can be done to respond or deter such behaviour in the future.","North Korea is believed to have been behind the WannaCry ransomware attack in May, the BBC has learned.","['The summary indicates that the attackers are from North Korea, not that North Korea, the State, is the attacker.']",[],0
"He was a multi-millionaire property developer with a wife and family going through a ""mid-life crisis"", she was the £10,000-a-month escort he pinned his hopes for a future on. Former burlesque dancer and stripper Georgina Symonds enjoyed the trappings of being with millionaire Peter Morgan - spa days, exclusive luxury hotel stays, a BMW and a Range Rover. He housed her rent-free in a bungalow in the vast grounds of the castle in Llanmartin, Newport, south Wales, he owned and gave her cash-in-hand to pay the bills, as well as paying for her to have full-body liposuction. Morgan, from a prominent and wealthy Welsh farming family, was infatuated with and hoped to build a future with the dancer he called ""George"", the woman for whom he left his wife of 23 years, the mother of his two children. Miss Symonds' childhood best friend Nadine Tilley said: ""She told me she was really happy and things were going well. She said he treated her well."" But when Miss Symonds' on/off boyfriend Peter Deem and her father both killed themselves within six months of one another, she turned to drink and drugs to cope. She started to blame Morgan, of Llanellen, near Abergavenny, for Mr Deem's suicide in November 2015, and for a meeting she then had with social services about the welfare of her daughter. Her mother and friends watched her verbally abuse him repeatedly, and said he ""just stood there and took it"" whilst remaining ""calm"". Mother Deborah Symonds told the murder trial at Newport Crown Court: ""She was trying to do things to upset him, to make him feel hurt but I don't think anything could make him hurt. ""That's what she said she was doing it for. She wanted him to have a bit of pain."" Morgan planted a listening device in her home which he nicknamed ""Isobel"" - which was essentially a SIM card and microphone hidden in an adaptor he could ring in to listen through. He said this was to monitor her drug use rather than spy on her, but he phoned the device 514 times during 10 weeks. Then, in January 2016, he overheard the mother-of-one on the phone talking about blackmailing him to ""fleece him"" for everything he had. Morgan, who had been seeing Miss Symonds for three years, knew she had sexually explicit photos and films of them having sex in his wife's home and the marital bed, and that she had previously successfully blackmailed at least three former clients. That night Morgan made a precise murder ""to do"" list on his phone, strangling Miss Symonds the next day in her home with orange baling twine. Before leaving the scene of the murder he fed Miss Symonds' three Jack Russells, did the washing up and put out the rubbish. He wrapped her body up in polythene sheeting and duct tape and put it in his car boot, before hiding it in a workshop at his estranged wife's farm in Beech Hill Farm in Usk, south Wales. Morgan then went about his daily business, including visiting the bank and going to the building site he was developing at that time, saying he just wanted to get back to his routine. He told police it was not until he got a phone call saying Miss Symonds had not picked up her daughter from school that he remembered he had strangled her to death. Later that night he confessed to killing her and, while refusing legal help, gave the police a detailed account of the events leading to her death. Despite this he pleaded not guilty to murder, pleading diminished responsibility due to having Asperger syndrome. The unusual defence was that the syndrome - a collection of personality traits - meant Mr Morgan had diminished responsibility and had committed manslaughter rather than murder. It was a complex argument built around the premise that Morgan saw things in such a black and white way he felt forced into a course of action someone else would not normally take. Giving evidence in the trial consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Phillip Joseph said Asperger syndrome could provide ""an explanation"" for the killing. He said: ""If he suffers from the condition it is at the very least a significant contributing factor."" Asperger syndrome is a form of autism, the difference being the person suffering from it does not have learning difficulties. They may have a very binary way of thinking, have difficulties communicating and crave routine and predictability rather than change. Someone with Asperger syndrome may also have very particular, obsessive interests, which they are keen to tell others about. Director of the Autism Research Centre Professor Simon Baron-Cohen told the court although there is not much research on Asperger syndrome and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in murder, there was growing awareness of how it could lead to the crime in a small number of cases. He added: ""There are an increasing number of cases that the courts are hearing about. When the alleged involved find themselves trapped in a certain way they might resort just through logic alone to the idea that they have to get rid of the person who is causing the threat. This is just an impression there is insufficient research to draw solid conclusions yet."" Morgan himself, who had built two successful businesses and was married with children, was said to initially find it inconceivable he could have Asperger syndrome. But Prof Baron-Cohen, who diagnosed Morgan just before the trial, said it explained a lot of the millionaire's actions both during and before the murder. He pointed to the businessman's preference to fix up machines rather than spend time with people, and his obsession with machinery and military history. Morgan kept excavators, cranes, tanks, an old American fire engine and motorbikes at his home, where he displayed his collection of guns such as an Uzi submachine gun, an AK-47 and Mossberg sawn-off shotgun on the walls. ""His accounts of his social relationships are not that","As Peter Morgan is found guilty of murdering Georgina Symonds, the BBC News website looks at how the relationship between the couple turned sour.","['The source text indicates Morgan pleaded not guilty to murder, claiming diminished responsibility due to Asperger syndrome.

"The poster with the phrase #prayforjosh appeared in Holywood by the A2 within the last week. It is part of a social media campaign supporting 13-year-old Joshua Martin, from Donaghadee, County Down. Life took a dramatic turn for the teenager when he was diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Eve. He was due to have an operation on his appendix at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. However, doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller growths. The news shocked Josh's family, but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world. It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Elim Church, where Josh's father is on the pastoral staff, and has since gone viral. The church's senior pastor, Gary Beattie, said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far. ""We were in total shock when he was diagnosed, and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh,"" Gary said. ""It certainly isn't a campaign as such, we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him. We had no idea that it would take off. ""We would use social media quite a lot because we have quite a young congregation, and we've been posting updates about Josh from his family. ""The update was shared 948 times and it's been seen by over 79,000 people. It's absolutely phenomenal. ""We thought there had been a mistake, but you can look at the views and where they've come from, and there are people all over the world supporting him, which is great."" But how did a social media hashtag lead to the appearance of the massive billboard? Gary said that last week a mystery donor paid for the sign and it was erected at Holywood playing fields. ""We do not know where it came from, we didn't put it there, but it means a lot to have such support,"" Gary said. There has also been a huge outpouring of support on Twitter for the Bangor Grammar pupil, with his classmates using the now-global hashtag for their friend.

"Jamie Taggart, from Argyll and Bute, failed to return from a plant-hunting trip to the northern mountainous area. He has not been seen since 2 November, when his rucksack and passport were found at a guest house in Sapa. Mr Taggart, 41, runs Linn Botanic Gardens in the village of Cove on the Rosneath peninsula and serves the area as a retained firefighter. Local police and the British embassy in Hanoi have been informed about his disappearance. Friend and fellow botanist Ian Sinclair, who has been liaising with the search parties, said they had been hampered by horrendous weather. ""The snow is continuing to melt, but there is a massive amount of snow damage to the forest such as collapsed trees,"" he said. ""The weather has been horrendous, with snow down to Sapa. This is extremely unusual as Sapa is upper tropical rainforest. ""A large group from the national park will be doing an intensive search once the snow melts."" A search due to begin on Tuesday will concentrate on four trails inside the forest of Lai Chau and Lao Cai, he said. Family and friends of Mr Taggart in his hometown of Cove have issued an appeal for funds to help cover the cost of the search. A Facebook page - Jamie Taggart Search - has also been set up. Organisations and individuals have so far raised thousands of pounds, including six-year-old Annie Ferguson of Cove who donated her Â£14.50 savings. The botanist's father, Jim Taggart, found out his son was missing when he failed to appear on a scheduled flight home to Scotland on 29 November. He had arrived at a guest house in Sapa on 30 October and left on a motorbike taxi to explore the hills. On 2 November his rucksack and passport were found at the accommodation. Dr Taggart previously told BBC Radio Scotland that he had received a handful of text messages from his son before contact stopped. ""I don't think he had got lost. Either something happened to him on his first day on the hills or there is some explanation we can only guess at,"" he said.

"Bottas, on whom Williams have a contractual hold, is Ferrari's number one option should they decide not to retain Kimi Raikkonen alongside Sebastian Vettel. Sources close to the deal say Ferrari and Williams have discussed Bottas's transfer but have no agreement yet. Williams view Button as a leading candidate should Bottas leave. Should the 2009 world champion join Williams in 2016, it would bring his career full circle. Media playback is not supported on this device . He made his F1 debut for Williams in 2000 before moving on to Benetton/Renault, BAR - which became Honda and then Brawn - and finally McLaren in a career in which he has won 15 grands prix. McLaren have not yet decided who they will pick to drive alongside Fernando Alonso in 2016. The team have a contractual option to retain Button, which means that the 2009 world champion cannot join another team unless McLaren decide not to keep him - or fail to decide until after whatever date is set in the contract as the team's deadline to do so. Their other options are their Danish reserve driver Kevin Magnussen, who raced for McLaren alongside Button in 2014, and the Belgian rising star Stoffel Vandoorne, who is leading the GP2 championship. McLaren have contracts with both men. Williams said they could not comment on driver contracts and Button said he had not yet considered his future. ""I've had a lot of questions thrown at me about what I am doing next year but I have not thought about anything, seriously,"" the 35-year-old said. ""I just have to get my head down and concentrate on improving the car and then in a couple of months we will sit down and talk about next year."" Media playback is not supported on this device . Bottas, on whom Williams have an option for the next two seasons, said he ""did not know"" whether he would be at Williams next season. ""Nothing is confirmed,"" the Finn said. ""We have to wait and see. As a driver, you want to know as soon as possible but sometimes you have to wait."" Although Ferrari have pursued various options, sources close to the team say they have decided to put off a decision on Raikkonen's future until later in the summer. Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne said last month that Raikkonen's ""future is in his own hands"" amid concerns at the team that he is not performing well enough compared to team-mate Sebastian Vettel. These come on the back of his poor season in 2014 during which he was comprehensively out-performed by former team-mate Alonso. Ferrari technical director James Allison said this week in an interview with an Italian magazine that Raikkonen was as fast as Vettel but that his results were being affected by the fact he was making more mistakes. Raikkonen said: ""I don't know any more than I knew at the start of the year. For me, the whole thing hasn't changed for months. If I knew I would easily say. Unfortunately I don't know. ""Somehow I end up every year in the same position, and it makes no difference if I have a contract or not. There is no contract, but there is an option now. ""I have made it very clear to the team what I would like to happen, and it is to be here next year."" If Bottas leaves and Button stays at McLaren, Williams may still look to McLaren's driver pool for a partner for Felipe Massa, on whom they have an option and is expected to stay.

But with eight minutes remaining on the clock, Jazz Richards picked out Bale and the 26-year-old met the ball with a thumping header that gave the excellent Antonis Georgallides in the Cyprus goal no chance. ""I've not scored too many better [headers] and at a vital time, which was important,"" added Bale. ""Obviously it wasn't our best performance in terms of attacking but we defended well as a unit and showed again what a good team we are. ""We try to defend as a team from front to back, but the backline were incredible. In the end we deserved to win, we created the better chances.""

But West Bromwich Albion defender James Chester has a chance of playing after his hamstring injury kept him out in Nicosia. West Ham United's James Collins is another option at the heart of defence. But after the performance of skipper Ashley Williams, Chris Gunter and Ben Davies in Nicosia, Wales manager Chris Coleman may be unwilling to tinker with his winning formula. Former Wales captain Kevin Ratcliffe: ""We kept it nice and tight at the back and weren't chasing things. ""Cyprus had a lot of possession in the second half but never really got in behind us and hurt us. ""I was a little bit concerned down the left-hand side on one or two occasions and I think a better side might have exploited that. ""We've got to rectify that for the next game, because Israel would have seen that we're lacking left-sided players with the nous to get across the pitch on a consistent basis.

"Two men have already been arrested and questioned on suspicion of theft and fraud offences. A man in his 30s is still being detained in Wexford. Another man arrested in Limerick on Monday has been released without charge. Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday the news that one of the London attackers - Rachid Redouane - moved there from Dublin should not alter existing travel arrangements between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The two men were arrested by Garda detectives and questioned about the use of documentation and Irish social security numbers in Redouane's name, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported. An Garda Síochána (Irish police) detectives are working to identify the activities, addresses and associates of Rachid Redouane during his time in Ireland. However, Gardaí have stressed their investigation is focused on theft and fraud offences rather than terror. The investigation into Redouane's time in Ireland has intensified over the past 48 hours. Thirty-year-old Redouane, who claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan, was based in the the east London suburb of Barking. He was also known by the name Rachid Elkhdar. Details of his identity and background began to emerge when an Irish identity card was found on his body after he was shot dead by police. It is understood he arrived in the UK in 2006 and applied for asylum but that the application was rejected in 2009. It is reported that he lived in Harrow in north-west London. The details of when he arrived in the Republic of Ireland or how long he stayed there are still not clear. However, it is believed he obtained a European Union residence permit which allowed him to travel to the UK whilst he lived in Ireland. He married a British woman, 38-year-old Charisse Ann O'Leary, in Dublin in 2012. It is understood that it was this marriage that allowed Redouane to obtain a 4 EU FAM card given to spouses of European Union citizens. The couple lived in Rathmines on Dublin's south-side. Reports suggest Redouane worked as a pastry chef. He left Ireland after the marriage and settled in the UK before returning to Ireland in 2015. Redouane is understood to have had a 17-month-old daughter with Ms O'Leary, although the couple were estranged. According to reports, he visited his child before carrying out the London attack along with Khuram Shazad Butt and Youssef Zaghba.

"""I'm really looking forward to it - the home of Scottish football,"" said Rodgers ahead of his maiden visit. ""I hear the pitch is good, a nice big pitch suits the speed in our team and our intensity. ""The technical area goes right out to the end of the pitch, but you might need a taxi to get back to your staff."" This will be Rodgers' second taste of the Old Firm derby and his experience of the fixture got off to a great start with a 5-1 league victory at Celtic Park last month. ""It was a brilliant performance by the players in every aspect,"" he recalled. ""Obviously this one is on a neutral ground, but we'll be looking to have a similar performance. ""We'll be prepared and focused. We know it's going to be a tough game. We anticipated that the last time."" Rodgers is also aware Celtic's visit to Hampden last season in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers ended in defeat. ""The last experience there wasn't so good for Celtic,"" he said. ""But it's a different team with a different mentality and we'll look to take that mentality into the game."" Rodgers lost two semi-finals in his time at Liverpool and is aiming to make it third time lucky at the club he joined in the summer. ""You have to perform - that's what's important and if you get little bit of luck along the way then hopefully you'll get the result that you want."" said the Northern Irishman. ""So, for us, it's really looking at our performance level, which in the main has been at a really high level. ""My focus is always on my own team and, if we impose our style of play, it can give a lot of problems to opponents."" Unlike predecessor Ronny Deila, Rodgers would not be drawn on this semi-final being a step on the way to a potential domestic treble. ""It's very, very difficult to achieve,"" he said. ""There's been great managers here in the past that haven't achieved that. ""But it's the first competition where we've a chance to win a trophy and I've always said that it's a priority for us because it's the first one.

"Bill Cosby 77 was to have been streamed from 27 November. It is not clear when or if the special will now be shown. Netflix's announcement came shortly after Tuesday's airing of an interview with a model and TV host who claimed Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982. Cosby's lawyer previously said the comedian would be making no comment. John P Schmidt said the allegations were a ""decade-old [and] discredited"" and that he did not intend to ""dignify [them] with any comment"". A follow-up statement amended the earlier denial to say it did not refer to Andrea Constand, an accuser whose civil action against him was settled in 2006. The latest allegation came from TV presenter Janice Dickinson, who accused Cosby of sexually assaulting her after a dinner date in Lake Tahoe, California. ""The next morning I woke up and I wasn't wearing my pyjamas,"" she told Entertainment Tonight. ""I remembered before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted."" Dickinson claimed she had written about the alleged assault in a 2002 autobiography but had been pressured by Cosby's lawyer and her publisher to remove the details. Dickinson, a contestant in the 2007 series of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, is one of several women to have accused Cosby of sexual assault going back almost 30 years. Cosby remained silent during an NPR radio interview that aired on Saturday when he was asked to comment on the accusations levelled against him.

"Media playback is not supported on this device . The Premier League paid £174m to agents, up from £130m, with Manchester City being the biggest spenders (£26.3m) ahead of Chelsea (£25.1m) and Manchester United (£19m). England's second tier, the Championship, spent £42.4m on agents, an increase of 62%. The Football Association figures cover from February 2016 to January 2017. They come two years after the last full-year results (2014-15). Premier League teams spent a record £1.38bn on transfers in the 2016-17 season - a 43% increase on transfer spending from the 2014-15 season. In both League One and League Two the total spending on agents and intermediaries decreased from the 2014-15 figures. League One sides spent £3,098,508, down from £3,167,964, while League Two teams spent £821,450, down from £1,007,920. Liverpool led the Premier League in agents' fees when the last full-year results were published for the period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, but the Reds' spending has decreased from £14.3m to £13.8 for the 2016-17 period. Manchester City now top the Premier League list with £26,3m, up from £12.4m, followed by Chelsea, who have also more than doubled their spending on agents' fees, up from £12m to £25.1m. Manchester United (£19m) and Arsenal (£10.2m) complete the top five, while Tottenham's outlay has risen from £6m to £7.2m. Yet despite being considered part of the Premier League's 'big six' clubs, Spurs trail behind West Ham (£9.5m) and Bournemouth (£7.4m) in agents' fees paid for 2016-17. Former England, West Ham and QPR winger Trevor Sinclair . I was very fortunate. I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually. On top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself. The influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power. In relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for £1m, why would there be another £1m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football. Jonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group . Agents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one. People get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter. However, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football. We get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly. Stoke City chairman Peter Coates . Football clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised. I wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5%, 10% or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get. There are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market. They play the field, which they're entitled to, and it's not easy.",English Premier League and Championship clubs spent more than £1bn on agents' fees in the 2016-17 season.,"[""the source text does not claim £1bn was spent on agents' fees, the only billion £ figure mentioned was in regards to transfer fees.""]",[],0

"The Scottish champions fielded a makeshift side in the 4-0 reverse and Rodgers was delighted with the 21-year-old he signed from Manchester City. ""For Ollie it's about fitness - you see how he moves in the game today,"" the Celtic manager said. ""He has the qualities to play at the very highest level."" Ntcham, a French international youth player, spent the past two seasons on loan at Genoa in Italy. He played for just over an hour of Saturday's friendly and Rodgers reckons that was enough to show how vital he will be. ""His range of passing, it makes the game look very simple,"" Rodgers added. ""He can play short, play long, he can dribble and shoot. ""He has everything to be a top, top level number eight. It's just timing really, that's his first game so 65 minutes was enough for him. He'll just build up his fitness over the next few weeks and when he's ready he'll be a big player for us."" Another player to have recently signed a four-year deal with Celtic, Kundai Benyu, has also made a big impression on his new boss. He played more than 70 minutes on Saturday and Rodgers admitted the 19-year-old, signed from Ipswich, has forced his way into contention. ""Young Kundai did really well,"" he said. ""He's surprised me to be honest. I knew he was a good player, you can see what we're trying to build here in terms of players who are technically gifted, but they have to have good mobility and good physicality, and he has that. He's come in and played with a nice little edge, he's competitive and he's got confidence. ""How he receives the ball is very good, he's an attacking player, he wants to get goals and he's actually quite exciting. ""Initially the plan was to have him in, thinking he would maybe get an idea of how we work and then go on loan, but I've sort of changed my mind on him after watching him. I think it's going to be good for him to have at least six months with us, see how we train, see how we work, get an education on our footballing idea then review it again in January and see where he's at.

"But there certainly should be. These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer. It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is. ""The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,"" says Essilor. But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry. Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: ""This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user. ""Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them. ""Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,"" Mr Ilett adds. If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry. It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. ""If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,"" he argues. In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. ""I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,"" he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was ""an undisputed leader with only 25% market share"" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as ""a complex and extremely competitive market-space"". Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review. These are: . An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. ""The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,"" he said. ""We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,"" he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. ""Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,"" the firm says. ""It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself."" If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros. For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros. With cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m","There is not much buzz about the planned merger of two of the world's biggest eyewear firms, Essilor and Luxottica.","[""The summary states there wasn't much buzz but this is nowhere in the article, nor inferrable from it""]",[],0

"WRU Chairman Gareth Davies confirmed the move was made after regions had ""upped the ante"" over the Wales international's contract. At least one other Welsh region has shown an interest in Williams, whose current contract ends next summer. ""It's over to the regions really to try and hopefully keep Scott Williams,"" Davies told Radio Wales Sport. ""The central contract from the union has been withdrawn after some of the regions started upping the ante, as it were."" The union's offer would have kept the player at the Scarlets. Dual contracts are funded 60% by the WRU and 40% by the region, and Davies' comments suggest the regions are offering bigger deals than the one they put on the table. It also hints that the WRU are not prepared to get involved in an auction of escalating bids. However, it appears that the player will stay in Wales, but with a region paying his contract in full. That situation would not upset the governing body, who set up the dual contracts to stop players moving abroad. ""It's difficult because we can't centrally contract everybody because of the funding issues - some players will be, some won't be,"" added Davies.

"The scandal, known as ""uranium-gate"", resulted from a 2011 transaction between French nuclear giant Areva and companies both in Niger and abroad. There is also a French investigation into some of Areva's business dealings, with aspects related to this deal. Areva has not commented on the legal case in Niger, but says it is cooperating in the French enquiry. Niger is one of the biggest uranium producers in the world and the metal is the country's largest export. Many people turned up on Friday morning outside the court in the capital, Niamey, as representatives of civil society movements arrived to register the court action, the BBC's Himadou Hamadou said. Their complaint alleges embezzlement of public funds, money laundering, forgery and conspiracy to defraud. The legal action centres on the allegation that Areva in 2011 bought a stock of uranium from Niger at a discounted price. Niger has two significant uranium mines that provides 7.5% of the world mining output from Africa's highest-grade uranium ores, according to the World Nuclear Association, the international organisation that represents the global nuclear industry. Niger's first commercial uranium mine began operating in 1971, with a strong government support for expanding uranium mining.",A court in Niger has opened a criminal investigation into alleged corruption in the country's uranium industry.,"['The source text doesn\'t state that there is a criminal investigation underway, just that it is ""alleged.""']",[],0

"Innogy Renewables UK Ltd had been proposing a hydroelectric scheme on the River Conwy, near Betws y Coed in Snowdonia National Park. But on Wednesday it said it had decided to shelve the Conwy Falls project. The application had been due to be considered by Conwy council planning committee next week. Innogy Renewables UK said the decision to withdraw the application was made following a late request for additional information. It said that Natural Resources Wales' river basin management plan for western Wales had been updated last December, including a change to the sensitivity of salmon fisheries, following which further information had been requested. The project, providing power to 3,200 households, attracted opposition from environmentalists, anglers, canoeists and businesses.

In March, the park's authority turned the plans down, asking for clarification on ""minor issues"". Innogy Renewables UK Ltd said it would now consider its next steps.

"Goals from Wilfried Zaha, Christian Benteke, Luka Milivojevic and Patrick van Aanholt secured Palace's own safety and sent Hull down. Hull could not afford to lose after Swansea had opened a four-point gap with a 2-0 win at Sunderland. Swansea's survival marks a remarkable turnaround in fortunes under Paul Clement. Clement, Swansea's third manager of the season after Bob Bradley and Franceso Guidolin, took over a side in January that was bottom with only 12 points from 19 game. The former Derby County manager's arrival at the Liberty Stadium saw an initial revival with Swansea winning three of his first five games in charge.

Swansea's 2-0 home win over Stoke City on 22 April was the start of a three-match unbeaten run which boosted their hopes of escaping relegation. Their 1-0 home victory over Everton saw them leapfrog Marco Silva's Hull, who had lost 2-0 at home to Sunderland earlier on Saturday, 7 May. And Swansea extended their unbeaten run to four games with a win in their penultimate game at already relegated Sunderland, which opened a four-point gap between the Welsh side and 18th-placed Hull.

The latter is a bone marrow disorder often leading to life-threatening bone marrow failure and even acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Results from two studies, which were funded by the charities Bloodwise and Cancer Research UK, have been published in the British Journal of Haematology. The researchers analysed samples from 134 myeloma patients, 80 MDS patients and 95 AML patients as part of the study. Prof Duncan Baird, who led the research, said: ""Our research provides strong evidence that shortening of telomeres [the DNA sections] plays a vital role in the progression of these blood cancers and that a significant number of patients should be receiving different levels of treatment. ""The next step is to assess telomere length in larger studies to establish how it can be integrated into existing assessments that predict patient outcome.""",Scientists at Dundee University have developed a new blood cancer test.,['The summary gives a name of the university not mentioned in the source text '],[],0

"The minimum prison term has risen from 20 to 40 years. It will apply for all abductions, including those that last only a few hours or days, so-called ""express kidnappings"". The maximum prison sentence will rise from 50 to 140 years for those who kill their victims. Kidnappings committed by a public security official, such as a member of the police or military, will be punished with up to 100 years in prison. Kidnappers will also have to pay heavy fines. In reality, few people ever receive sentences longer than 60 years for federal crimes, but kidnapping is considered in a separate category. The number of kidnappings reported to the police has risen dramatically in Mexico in recent years. In 2007, 438 kidnappings were reported, but the number had risen to almost 1,700 last year. And the government estimates the number of kidnappings reported to the police could be fewer than 2% of the total. If that is the case, the real number of abductions could be about 105,000 per year. Analysts say accurate figures are hard to come by, as many abductions only last for hours or a few days until the victims empty their bank accounts at gunpoint or pay a ransom. Most are never reported to the authorities for fear of reprisals from the criminal gang which carried out the kidnapping. In January this year the Mexican government launched a nationwide effort to fight kidnapping. A federal prosecutor, Renato Sales, was named to head an anti-kidnapping committee that would co-ordinate efforts to fight abductions in the 10 Mexican states (out of 31) where 74% of all kidnappings take place. ""Mexico needs to deal quickly and efficiently with the humanitarian emergency that this crime entails,"" said Mr Sales at the time.",Mexico's Congress has approved tough new sentences for kidnappings.,"['The summary states that the Mexico Congress approved the new sentences,but the text did not state who exactly in Mexico is responsible for the new sentences']",[],0

"BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Vincent Kearney said it is possible the weapon was an AK47, which has previously been used in dissident republican attacks. Up to eight shots struck the passenger side of the car parked at Rossnareen Avenue, at about 18:50 GMT on Thursday. Two male officers who were in the car were not injured but were said to have been badly shaken. Police described it as a ""mindless, reckless attempt to kill officers"".
